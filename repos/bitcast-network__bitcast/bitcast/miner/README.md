# Bitcast Miner

A YouTube token server which enables mining on the Bitcast subnet. Responds to validator requests with a temporary read access token for the YouTube APIs.

> **Notice**  
> Your YouTube channel is a valuable asset. Bitcast aims to create meaningful opportunities for creators but early-stage Bittensor subnets can be unpredictable environments. We encourage you to participate thoughtfully, as we will not take any responsibility for unexpected changes to your channel's performance.

## 🎥 Content Requirements

> **Don't register until you hit these!**  
> **Note: Content requirements are likely to increase over time**

1. **YouTube account**  
   - 21+ days old
   - ≥ 100 subscribers
   - ≥ 10% average retention (over the last 90 days)
   - ≥ 1000 minutes watched (over the last 90 days)
   - **YouTube Partner Program (YPP) membership OR sufficient alpha stake** (see note below)

2. **Videos**  
   - Public  
   - Auto-generated captions only  
   - Matches at least one [content brief](http://dashboard.bitcast.network/briefs)  
   - Published during the brief content window

**Tip:** Test your script against any brief in our [dashboard tool](http://dashboard.bitcast.network/).

> **Note: YouTube Partner Program (YPP) Requirement**  
> Channels must either:
> - Be enrolled in the YouTube Partner Program (with CPM > 0 within last 90 days)
> - **OR** have 1k alpha staked against your mining hotkey
> 
> This filter is in place as a barrier for low quality or exploitative miners. Minimum stake indicates investment in the long term success of the subnet.
> If you connot personally meet the minimum stake threshold reach out to the subnet owner or another significant holder of Bitcast alpha token for sponsorship - acceptance may depend on the quality of your YouTube channel and content.

## 💻 System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux (required)
- **CPU:** 1 core
- **RAM:** 2 GB

Bitcast Miner is designed to run 24/7. For best results, use a reliable remote Linux server or VPS (such as AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, or Hetzner) to ensure continuous uptime. Avoid running on a laptop or desktop that may be powered off or disconnected.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bitcast-network/bitcast.git
   cd bitcast
   ```

2. **Setup environment & venv**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/setup_env.sh
   ./scripts/setup_env.sh
   ```  
   This creates a Python virtual environment at `../venv_bitcast/` and installs dependencies.

## 🚀 Run Miner

1. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp bitcast/miner/.env.example bitcast/miner/.env
   ```
   Edit `.env` with your wallet information:
   - `WALLET_NAME`: Your Bittensor wallet name (coldkey)
   - `HOTKEY_NAME`: Your Bittensor hotkey name

2. **Authenticate with YouTube**  
   Run the authentication setup script:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/run_auth.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Set up your environment if needed
   - Guide you through YouTube OAuth authentication  
   - Work in all environments (headless, SSH, Docker, etc.)
   - Provide a URL to copy/paste into any browser

3. **Open port 8091**  
   Ensure your firewall or cloud security group allows inbound on **8091**.

4. **Start miner**  
   ```bash
   bash scripts/run_miner.sh
   ```

5. **pm2 Launch & Health Check**  
   The `run_miner.sh` script uses **pm2** to manage the miner process.  
   - List running processes:  
     ```bash
     pm2 list
     ```  
   - View logs in real-time:  
     ```bash
     pm2 logs bitcast_miner
     ```  
   - Check detailed status:  
     ```bash
     pm2 show bitcast_miner
     ```  
   - If the miner isn't running, you can restart it:  
     ```bash
     pm2 restart bitcast_miner
     ```

## 🔧 Managing Permissions

To view or revoke the permissions you've granted to your miner application, visit:
[Google Account Connections](https://myaccount.google.com/connections?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Fdata-and-privacy)

If you revoke access, you'll need to re-authenticate using `bash scripts/run_auth.sh`.

## 🏢 Agency Operations (Multiple YouTube Accounts)

You can run a single miner with **up to 5 YouTube accounts** to operate as an agency:

- The `run_auth.sh` script only authenticates **one** account at a time
- To add more accounts, place additional `.pkl` credential files in `bitcast/miner/secrets/`
- All `.pkl` files in the secrets directory will be included in miner responses
- Use our open-source [agency web template](https://github.com/bitcast-network/bitcast-agency) to accept credentials from other creators

This allows you to aggregate multiple creators under a single mining UID while maintaining separate YouTube account credentials.

## ℹ️ General Notes

- **3-day emissions delay:** You'll begin receiving miner emissions **3 days** after the miner starts.  
- **Video age limit:** Each video will be rewarded for its first 14 days of engagement as long as it is posted during the active brief window.
- **Validator polling:** Each validator sends a request roughly every **4-5 hours**.  
- **Video processing limit:** A maximum of **75 recent videos** will be processed per YouTube account.  
- **Process visibility:** Validator logs can be viewed in the [bitcast wandb project](https://wandb.ai/bitcast_network/bitcast_vali_logs?nw=nwuserwill_bitcast)  
- **Auto-updates:** The codebase has auto-update enabled by default.

## 🔄 Staying Healthy

- Once healthy, your miner auto-detects and scores new uploads.  
- **Briefs change**—check [content briefs](http://dashboard.bitcast.network/briefs) regularly.  

Happy mining! 🚀
