Prompt templates for brief evaluation.

This module contains all prompt templates used for evaluating video content against briefs.
Each version represents a different evaluation approach.

How to add a new prompt version:
1. Create a new function generate_brief_evaluation_prompt_vX (where X is the version number)
2. Add the function to the PROMPT_GENERATORS registry
3. Update tests to validate the new version
4. Briefs can then specify "prompt_version": X to use the new format

The system defaults to the latest version.

    Generate a prompt that forces the LLM to prove each brief item

    Improvements over the old version:
    • Instructs the model to auto-number the brief items.
    • Requires a 5-15-word quote for every Met claim.
    • Demands the raw `start` time (seconds) from the transcript as evidence.
    • States that uncertain or fabricated timestamps → Not Met.
    • Re-emphasises “description-only” items.
