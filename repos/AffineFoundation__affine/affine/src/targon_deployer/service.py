"""Targon deployer reconciliation loop.

Closed-loop auto-deployment over a small set of "targets" drawn from the
current champion plus the strongest currently-sampling challengers:

    targets = { champion } ∪ top-N challengers ranked by
                  (consecutive_wins > 0  DESC,   # winners first
                   first_block           ASC)    # within tier, earliest-submitted first
              where challenge_status == 'sampling'
    |targets| ≤ MAX_TARGON_DEPLOYMENTS   (default 8, env-configurable)

Each loop iteration:

    1. Resolve targets from system_config.champion + miner_stats.
    2. For every target: ensure a Targon deployment exists (adopt matching
       live workload if present; otherwise create).
    3. Tear down any deployment whose (hotkey, revision) is no longer a
       target — covers champion change, challenger termination, challenger
       losing its only win, etc. Teardown is immediate (no 24h grace).
    4. Health sweep: probe every active/deploying deployment. The
       authoritative signal is an active OpenAI /v1/models probe against
       the workload — Targon's container-level state lags vLLM in both
       directions (ready_replicas can stay 0 for a minute after the model
       has actually loaded, and stays 1 after a rebuild has wiped /data
       while vLLM is re-downloading), so trusting it would either miss
       a serving deployment or keep routing to a broken one. /v1/models
       is exactly what task fetch sees when it routes traffic.

       Release is time-based, not count-based: a deployment must be
       continuously unhealthy for at least TARGON_UNHEALTHY_RELEASE_SEC
       (default 600s = 10 min) before we delete it. Targon's CDN has
       occasional minute-long network blips and miner-side vLLM can pause
       for a few minutes during prefill — a faster trigger would churn
       perfectly fine deployments. Once released, the miner re-enters the
       queue next cycle.

       Freshly-created deployments get TARGON_INITIAL_LOAD_GRACE_SEC
       (default 1800s) to complete their first model download before the
       failure clock even starts — long enough for typical Affine miner
       models (~30B params), short enough that a stuck container doesn't
       waste a whole day.

        Champion gets slot 0; remaining slots are filled from sampling
        miners ranked by:

            (has_wins   DESC,   # consecutive_wins > 0 → True before False
             first_block ASC)   # within a tier, earliest submitter first

        Eligibility filter (applies to *both* champion and challengers):
          - is_valid == 'true'                   (validator admits it)
          - chute_status == 'hot'                (Chutes is serving)
          - challenge_status == 'sampling'       (challengers only)
          - (hotkey, revision) != champion's     (no double counting)

        Why is_valid is required, not just chute_hot: the chute_hot
        filter catches the *common* invalidation paths because most
        of them clear chute_status as a side effect (chute_fetch_failed,
        chute_slug_empty, chute_not_hot). But anticopy, model_mismatch,
        repo-name violations, revision_mismatch, hf_model_fetch_failed,
        and multiple_commits all leave chute_status='hot' while flipping
        is_valid='false'. Sampling scheduler also gates on is_valid via
        get_valid_miners(), so without the same gate here the deployer
        burns GPU on miners no one is actually sampling. UID 187's
        anticopy case is the canonical example.

        Why is_valid applies to champion too: dethrone-protection is
        meant to ride out a *transient Chutes blip* — short hiccups
        in the network/CDN. validator-side invalidation (anticopy,
        repo-name) is deterministic, not transient, and sampling
        scheduler stops sampling the champion anyway. Keeping the
        deployment costs GPU-hours for nothing. Once is_valid flips
        back to 'true', the deployer recreates the slot on the next
        reconcile.

        Why Chutes-hot is a hard filter for challengers: a cold Chutes
        is the cheapest "miner has effectively dropped offline" signal
        we have. Spending Targon GPU-hours on those slots throws money
        away — the miner is likely to churn soon. We'd rather leave
        the slot empty than waste it.

        Side effect: a previously-eligible incumbent that goes
        invalid/cold falls out of the target set and gets torn down on
        this reconcile, freeing the slot for the next queued candidate.

        Returns list of (hotkey, revision, role) where role ∈ {'champion','winner'}.
