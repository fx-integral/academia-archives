## Community

In the competitive world of Bittensor subnets, we understand that miners may be reluctant to share their success strategies. However, we still encourage you to post your ideas, experiences, and breakthroughs to the community. The technology behind general AI agents (or embodied agent, generally-capable agent) is in its early stages. Open discussion and collaboration are key to accelerating progress, and will ultimately benefit everyone in the long run. Eastworld subnet will maintain continuous evolution through periodic integration of cutting-edge research advancements.

## Basic Concepts

### Background Story

The virtual world's background story unfolds in an unspecified future era. The Miner, an intelligent robotic agent (designated Agent _UID_), serves as crew aboard a spacecraft. When the vessel catastrophically crashes into a canyon during flight operations, the AI Agent must now help the surviving crew endure the extreme environmental conditions.


### Synapse Data

Check the `protocol.Observation` synapse definition. The validator will send the following data to miners:

* `stats`: Data such as Agent integrity, energy level, etc. (Not yet implemented).
* `items`: The items and item amount, description in Agent's inventory.
* `sensor`: LiDAR and Odometry data indicating distance and space. This will be explained further in the next section.
* `perception`: Text descriptions of the surrounding environment, including terrain, characters, and objects. And a list of environmental interactions, such as passive dialogue, damage, etc.
* `action_log`: The result of the last action executed.
* `action_space`: A list of available actions in the OpenAI function call definition format.
* `reward`: Agent's current weighted score

The miner's primary task is to process all this information and respond with a valid function call to control the robotic agent.


### Compass Directions

Eastworld subnet uses 8 global directions to describe position relations:

  - north (Cardinal directions)
  - east
  - south
  - west
  - northeast (Ordinal directions)
  - southeast
  - southwest
  - northwest


### LiDAR Scanner Data Interpretation:

The LiDAR data indicates whether a direction is passable:

  - intense: Indicates a strong reflection signal, meaning the direct path is completely blocked.  
  - strong: Indicates a relatively strong reflection signal, suggesting there is an obstacle nearby, but forward movement may still be possible.  
  - moderate: Indicates a moderate signal strength, implying no obstacles in the mid-to-short range, and passage is possible.  
  - weak: Indicates a weak reflection signal, meaning the path ahead is clear of obstacles.  

The current LiDAR data implementation also provides directional distance measurements with meter-level precision.


### Available Actions

The `action_space` contains comprehensive definitions (including descriptions and parameters) for all actions. Please avoid hardcoding them in the prompt. The basic action list is as follows:

  - **move_in_direction**: Moves in the specified direction. The minimum safe moving distance is 5m.
    * The current system design is discrete and therefore does not support arbitrary precision movement.
    * To simulate execution deviations in the real world, the system incorporates random variations. For example, the brain(high-level cognitive controller) might command a 10-meter movement, but environmental complexities could result in an actual movement that is slightly longer or shorter.

  - **move_to_target**: Move towards the specified target entity. Target can be a character or a location and must be in sight. If the distance is too far, it may not be possible to plan a direct route.

  - **talk_to**: Talk to other entity. Accepts the name of the target and the content you want to say. The target may not hear you beyond 10 meters.

  - **inspect**: Examine a specified target to obtain detailed information, such as character status, item identification, or device operation instructions. The target must be within 15 meters.

  - **collect**: Collect resources or items from the specified target entity. This action can only be performed when the target is within close range (less than or equal to 5m).

  - **discard_item**: Discard items from agent's compartment.

  - **emergency_return**: Initiates an emergency rescue request, notifying fleet members to return you to the spaceship. Please note, all items on your compartment will be discarded. And due to system diagnostics, you will be unable to perform any actions(no synapse from validator) for an extended period. (For more efficient debugging and development, the cooldown penalty is not enabled on the testnet)

  - **xxx_exchange**: Item exchange related actions. See [Exchange Protocol](exchange_protocol.md) to learn more.


OpenAI style function schema in synapse `Observation.action_space`: 

```
[
  {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
          "name": "move_in_direction",
          "description": "Moves in the specified direction.",
          "parameters": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                  "direction": {

                      "enum": ["north", "northeast", "east", "southeast", "south", "southwest", "west", "northwest"],
                      "description": "The direction you try to move."
                  },
                  "distance": {
                      "type": "number",
                      "description": "The distance in meters to move in the specified direction. Note that the actual moving distance may be different from the expected value. Valid input range is 0 to 20 meters."
                  }
              },
              "required": ["direction", "distance"]
          }
      }
  },
...
]
```

### Quest System

Most quests are advanced through conversation (`talk_to`) rather than separate commands. This design creates more immersive, real-life like interactions for AI Agents.

Some quests have been revealed to help new miners more efficiently understand the challenges their agents will face and catch up with the old miners. Check the [Quest List](agent_quest.md) for details.


## Reference Miners

### Junior Agent

The `JuniorAgent` is a naive implementation of the ReAct paradigm with an ephemeral memory system.


### Reasoning Agent

Usually, the response time of a reasoning model is too long to fit within the 20-second timeout of validator requests. `ReasoningAgent` adopts an asynchronous reflection architecture that effectively avoids timeouts while retaining the full capabilities of reasoning models. It is still a basic agent following the ReAct paradigm, but thanks to the reasoning models, it demonstrates enhanced cognitive efficacy without introducing a complicated workflow.

Here are a few **IMPORTANT** things to note:

- The miner is runnable but intended as a reference or demo. You are encouraged to develop your own.

- There is no unified interface for reasoning model providers; you need to modify the code according to the model you use. `ReasoningAgent` is built on OpenAI's API.

- Reasoning models are much more expensive. Please calculate the cost and usage before deploying online.


### Senior Agent

The `SeniorAgent` provides a modular framework for architecting general-purpose AI agents with integrated navigation and cognitive capabilities.

The code in `action_execution` also exemplifies the integration of local and remote function calls to extend agent capabilities, demonstrating a hybrid execution paradigm.

#### Installation

`SeniorAgent` introduces extra dependencies. Install with `uv`:

```
uv sync --extra miner
uv pip install -e .
```

If you have encounterd "Segmentation fault" running miner, please build GTSAM from source (develop branch)

```
git clone https://github.com/borglab/gtsam.git

# After install the gtsam requirements (boost, cmake, etc)

cd gtsam/python
uv pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
cmake .. -DGTSAM_BUILD_PYTHON=1 -DGTSAM_PYTHON_VERSION= **YOUR PYTHON VERSION**
make

cd python && uv pip install .
# Or `make python-install` if you're using pip only

```

GTSAM official install reference: https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/tree/develop/python


#### SLAM

Two algorithm approaches are provided to demonstrate SLAM integration with sensor data in the Synapse:

* FastSLAM
* ISAM (default)

And a simple web page to visualize the SLAM status:

```
python eastworld/miner/slam/console.py --port 5000
```

#### Memory

The `JSONFileMemory` class persists agent memory data in JSON format to a `memory.json` file within the working directory by default. For production deployments, we recommend implementing alternative storage backends like SQLite or other persistent database solutions.

#### LLM Provider

While `SeniorAgent` employs the generic OpenAI SDK for LLM calls and is theoretically model-agnostic, the current implementation specifically utilizes the Gemini 2.0 model (selected for its notable inference speed). Note that prompt engineering is optimized for Gemini's architecture, and modifying the LLM provider requires a little code adjustments, such as adjusting hard-coded model names.
