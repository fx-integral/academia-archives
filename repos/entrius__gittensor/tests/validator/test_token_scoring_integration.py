Integration tests for tree-diff token scoring pipeline.

These tests exercise the full scoring pipeline with real file contents,
verifying:
- Tree-sitter AST parsing and comparison
- Structural vs leaf score breakdown
- Comment exclusion from scoring
- Node counting and scoring for additions and deletions
