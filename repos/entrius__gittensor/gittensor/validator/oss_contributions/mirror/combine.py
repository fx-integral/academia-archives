"""Merge a `MirrorMinerEvaluation` into the legacy `MinerEvaluation`.

Single explicit join point between the two scoring paths:
- Mirror PR lists land in the ``mirror_*`` slots on the MinerEvaluation
- ``unique_repos_contributed_to`` is unioned
- ``github_pr_fetch_failed`` is OR'd
- ``mirror_pr_fetch_failed`` is materialized so the validator can tell
  a complete mirror outage apart from a legacy partial-pagination failure
  when deciding cache fallback strategy

Per-PR scoring breakdowns (token_score, nodes_scored, base_score, earned_score,
collateral_score) live on each ScoredMirrorPR — they get aggregated into
MinerEvaluation totals by ``finalize_miner_scores`` walking both paths' lists,
not at combine time.

Mutates legacy_eval in place. On delete-day this whole module goes away — at
that point `MirrorMinerEvaluation` becomes the canonical container.
