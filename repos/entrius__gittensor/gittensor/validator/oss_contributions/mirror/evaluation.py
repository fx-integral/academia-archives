"""Scratch container for the mirror scoring path.

`MirrorMinerEvaluation` lives only during ``evaluate_miners_pull_requests``.
Both load and score phases write into it; ``combine`` then rolls its data
into the existing ``MinerEvaluation`` for downstream consumers.

Field names here are deliberately unprefixed (``merged_prs``, not
``mirror_merged_prs``) — within this container's namespace there's no
ambiguity. The ``mirror_*`` prefix only appears on ``MinerEvaluation`` where
both paths' data coexist.
