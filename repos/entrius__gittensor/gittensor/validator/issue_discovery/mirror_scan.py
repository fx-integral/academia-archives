"""Issue discovery via the das-github-mirror service.

Replaces the timeline-scraping legacy path for mirror-enabled repos. Mirror
returns per-miner issues with an authoritative ``solved_by_pr`` and an inline
``solving_pr`` carrying everything needed to classify the discovery: author_id,
merge state, hours_since_merge, edited_after_merge, review_summary, shas.

Populates the existing ``MinerEvaluation`` issue-discovery fields directly
(``issue_discovery_score``, ``total_solved_issues``, etc.) so downstream
emission blending / normalization doesn't change.

Anti-gaming gates (all applied):
- solved_by_pr must be populated
- solving_pr.state == 'MERGED'
- not solving_pr.edited_after_merge
- issue.last_edited_at <= solving_pr.merged_at (anti-spec-rewrite)
- issue.state_reason == 'COMPLETED' (not NOT_PLANNED, not null)
- not issue.is_transferred
- issue.author_github_id != solving_pr.author_github_id (anti-self-issue)

Same-account ("solver is also discoverer") gives credibility only — no
discovery score. One-issue-per-PR rule is round-global: a single solving PR
awards at most one discovery score across the entire validator round, even
when it closes issues authored by different miners. The earliest-created
qualifying issue across all miners wins; the rest are credibility only.

Base-score resolution uses a per-cycle cross-miner cache. Most solving PRs on
mirror-enabled repos will be miners' own PRs that OSS scoring already tokenized;
the cache pre-populates from every miner's ``mirror_merged_prs`` so those hits
require no HTTP. Non-miner-solved PRs (cache misses) trigger
``MirrorClient.get_pr_files`` + token scoring, with the result written back to
the cache so sibling discoveries benefit.
