# Gittensor Contributor Guide

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev
   ```

2. Install git hooks:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install --install-hooks
   ```

   This installs pre-commit and pre-push hooks. Ruff lint/format runs on every
   commit; pyright and pytest run before push.

3. Run all checks manually:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files                        # pre-commit hooks
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push  # pre-push hooks
   ```

4. To skip hooks for WIP commits or pushes:
   ```bash
   git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: ..."
   git push --no-verify
   ```

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please:

1. Read the [README](./README.md) to understand the project goals
2. Understand Miner and Validator interactions/design
3. Check existing issues, PRs, and discussions to avoid duplicate work

## Creating Issues

When opening an issue, use the appropriate template:

- **[Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)** - Report bugs or unexpected behavior. Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.
- **[Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)** - Suggest new features or improvements. Explain the motivation and proposed solution.
- **Blank Issue** - For issues that don't fit the above templates.

For security vulnerabilities, **do not create a public issue**. Report them privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/entrius/gittensor/security/advisories/new).

## Lifecycle of a Pull Request

### 1. Create Your Branch

- Branch off of `test` and target `test` with your PR
- Ensure there are no conflicts before submitting

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, well-documented code
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Update documentation if applicable
- Update tests and create new tests if there are new functions or older testing is outdated

  _NOTE: We do NOT accept PRs that are only testing changes/additions, they will need to be backed up with a good reason_

- Do NOT add comments that are over-explanatory, redundant
- When making your changes, ask yourself: will this raise the value of the repository?
- Ensure ALL tests pass, the PR will not be accepted if there are failing tests

#### CLI Changes

Any PR that changes CLI output (new commands, altered output shape, changed formatting, new flags that change what gets printed, modified error messages) **must include before-and-after evidence** in the PR description:

- Before and after **screenshots** of the terminal running the affected command(s), _or_
- A short **screen recording** showing the old and new behavior

This applies to any `gittensor/cli/**` change that affects what the user sees. Non-output-affecting CLI changes (internal refactors, argument parsing that doesn't surface in output, type annotations) are exempt.

PRs missing this evidence may be closed without review, or returned for updates at the maintainers' discretion.

### 3. Submit Pull Request

1. Push your branch to the repository
2. Open a PR targeting the `test` branch
3. Use draft PRs for work-in-progress changes
4. Fill out the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md):
   - **Summary**: Clear description of changes
   - **Related Issues**: Link issues using `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`
   - **Type of Change**: Select bug fix, new feature, refactor, documentation, or other
   - **Testing**: Confirm tests added/updated and manual testing performed
   - **Checklist**: Verify code style, self-review, and documentation

### 4. Code Review

- Assign `anderdc` and `landyndev` to your PR for review

## PR Labels

Apply appropriate labels to help categorize and track your contribution:

- `bug` - Bug fixes
- `feature` - New feature additions
- `enhancement` - Improvements to existing features
- `refactor` - Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `documentation` - Documentation updates

## Contribution Scope

### Out of Scope

The following directories are **not accepting external contributions**:

- `smart-contracts/` — All ink!/Rust smart contracts
- Any other Rust crates in this repository

Changes to these directories will be closed without review. If you have questions or suggestions related to the smart contracts, open a discussion or issue instead.

### In Scope

Contributions are welcome for the Python codebase, including the validator, miner, CLI, and associated tests.

## Code Standards

### Quality Expectations

- Follow repository conventions (commenting style, variable naming, etc.)
- Use sensible helper functions to modularize code
- Code that is drawn out or obviously unoptimized to artificially inflate line count will be rejected
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code
- Avoid modifying unrelated files
- Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies
- Ensure all tests pass

## Branches

### `test`

**Purpose**: Testing and staging for main

**Restrictions**:

- Requires pull request
- Requires tests to pass
- Requires one approval from either `@landyndev` or `@anderdc`

### `main`

**Purpose**: Production-ready code

**Restrictions**:

- Only maintainers can update
