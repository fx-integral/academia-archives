# Decentralized Bitcoin Mining & Lightning Infrastructure

# What is InfiniteHash?

InfiniteHash Subnet (SN89) is revolutionizing Bitcoin mining by combining decentralized mining operations with cutting-edge Lightning Network infrastructure. We're building a truly decentralized and more democratic Bitcoin mining pool AND in parallel the foundation for Bitcoin to become the preferred payment layer for the emerging AI agent economy via our enterprise quality Lightning network.

# How It Works

Phase 1 (launch): Market Discovery
- Miners contribute hashrate and earn Alpha tokens proportional to contribution
- All mined Bitcoin is converted to Alpha and burned, creating continuous buying pressure
- Market discovers sustainable Alpha-to-hashrate conversion rates

Phase 2: Sustainable Economics
- Minimum hashrate threshold for base rewards - no incentive for overcommitting hash
- Alpha denominated hashprice designed to exceed BTC hashprice available in market, after pool fees. Min hashrate threshold adjusted routinely
- Miners also run Lightning nodes and compete (creating uid curve) on quality for incremental rewards beyond hashrate

# Getting Started

# For Miners

Requirements / Getting Started (V1)

- Bitcoin ASIC miners
- Bittensor baseminer - no SN specific configurations. Validators score your hash contribution based on your hotkey in the ASIC workerID
- Point Your ASICs to Our Pool


Pool URL: stratum+tcp://btc.global.luxor.tech:700 (or choose a specific regional stratum if desired).

Configure Worker Names
  - Format: `infinite.YOUR_HOTKEY.your_workerID`
  - YOUR_HOTKEY: Your Bittensor wallet hotkey
  - your_workerID: Any identifier you choose for your ASIC fleet

Examples:
```
infinite.5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY.1
infinite.5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY.warehouse_a
```

# Validators

For a detailed description of the auction-based incentive mechanism and validator responsibilities, see `docs/subnet_auction_incentive_system.md`.

## Deployment workflow

1. **Build container**  
   Push to `deploy-build-prod`. CI builds and pushes `ghcr.io/backend-developers-ltd/infinitehash-subnet-prod:v0-latest`.

2. **Update compose digest**  
   ```sh
   python tools/update_compose_digest.py
   ```
   The script fetches the latest manifest digest for `v0-latest` and rewrites `envs/deployed/docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Publish configuration**  
   Commit the compose change and push to `deploy-config-prod`. Validator nodes (via the cron installed by `installer/install.sh`) pull this branch and restart services with the pinned digest.


# Base requirements

- docker with [compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
- python 3.11
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes)

# Setup development environment

```sh
./setup-dev.sh
docker compose up -d
cd app/src
uv run manage.py wait_for_database --timeout 10
uv run manage.py migrate
uv run manage.py runserver
```

### Optional: expose Postgres to the host

The default compose stack keeps the database internal to the Docker network.  
Set `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` in `envs/dev/.env` (or your root `.env`) to the host port you want to publish (`8432` by default).  
Clearing `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` prevents any host binding.

When you set `POSTGRES_READONLY_USER` and `POSTGRES_READONLY_PASSWORD`, the `db-readonly-user`
helper container automatically creates/updates that login with SELECT-only permissions so you can
safely share the exposed port.

# Setup production environment (git deployment)

<details>

This sets up "deployment by pushing to git storage on remote", so that:

- `git push origin ...` just pushes code to Github / other storage without any consequences;
- `git push production master` pushes code to a remote server running the app and triggers a git hook to redeploy the application.

```
Local .git ------------> Origin .git
                \
                 ------> Production .git (redeploy on push)
```

- - -

Use `ssh-keygen` to generate a key pair for the server, then add read-only access to repository in "deployment keys" section (`ssh -A` is easy to use, but not safe).

```sh
# remote server
mkdir -p ~/repos
cd ~/repos
git init --bare --initial-branch=master infinite-hashes.git

mkdir -p ~/domains/infinite-hashes
```

```sh
# locally
git remote add production root@<server>:~/repos/infinite-hashes.git
git push production master
```

```sh
# remote server
cd ~/repos/infinite-hashes.git

cat <<'EOT' > hooks/post-receive
#!/bin/bash
unset GIT_INDEX_FILE
export ROOT=/root
export REPO=infinite-hashes
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
    if [[ $ref =~ .*/master$ ]]; then
        export GIT_DIR="$ROOT/repos/$REPO.git/"
        export GIT_WORK_TREE="$ROOT/domains/$REPO/"
        git checkout -f master
        cd $GIT_WORK_TREE
        ./deploy.sh
    else
        echo "Doing nothing: only the master branch may be deployed on this server."
    fi
done
EOT

chmod +x hooks/post-receive
./hooks/post-receive
cd ~/domains/infinite-hashes
sudo bin/prepare-os.sh
./setup-prod.sh

# adjust the `.env` file

mkdir letsencrypt
./letsencrypt_setup.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Deploy another branch

Only `master` branch is used to redeploy an application.
If one wants to deploy other branch, force may be used to push desired branch to remote's `master`:

```sh
git push --force production local-branch-to-deploy:master
```

# Background tasks with Celery

## Dead letter queue

<details>
There is a special queue named `dead_letter` that is used to store tasks
that failed for some reason.

A task should be annotated with `on_failure=send_to_dead_letter_queue`.
Once the reason of tasks failure is fixed, the task can be re-processed
by moving tasks from dead letter queue to the main one ("celery"):

    manage.py move_tasks "dead_letter" "celery"

If tasks fails again, it will be put back to dead letter queue.

To flush add tasks in specific queue, use

    manage.py flush_tasks "dead_letter"
</details>

# Monitoring

Running the app requires proper certificates to be put into `nginx/monitoring_certs`,
see [nginx/monitoring_certs/README.md](nginx/monitoring_certs/README.md) for more details.

## Monitoring execution time of code blocks

Somewhere, probably in `metrics.py`:

```python
some_calculation_time = prometheus_client.Histogram(
    'some_calculation_time',
    'How Long it took to calculate something',
    namespace='django',
    unit='seconds',
    labelnames=['task_type_for_example'],
    buckets=[0.5, 1, *range(2, 30, 2), *range(30, 75, 5), *range(75, 135, 15)]
)
```

Somewhere else:

```python
with some_calculation_time.labels('blabla').time():
    do_some_work()
```


# Cloud deployment

## AWS

<details>
Initiate the infrastructure with Terraform:
TODO

To push a new version of the application to AWS, just push to a branch named `deploy-$(ENVIRONMENT_NAME)`.
Typical values for `$(ENVIRONMENT_NAME)` are `prod` and `staging`.
For this to work, GitHub actions needs to be provided with credentials for an account that has the following policies enabled:

- AutoScalingFullAccess
- AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess

See `.github/workflows/cd.yml` to find out the secret names.

For more details see [README_AWS.md](README_AWS.md)
</details>

## Vultr

<details>
Initiate the infrastructure with Terraform and cloud-init:

- see Terraform template in `<project>/devops/vultr_tf/core/`
- see scripts for interacting with Vultr API in `<project>/devops/vultr_scripts/`
  - note these scripts need `vultr-cli` installed

For more details see [README_vultr.md](README_vultr.md).

# Backups

<details>
<summary>Click to for backup setup & recovery information</summary>

Backups are managed by `backups` container.

## Local volume

By default, backups will be created [periodically](backups/backup.cron) and stored in `backups` volume.

### Backups rotation
Set env var:
- `BACKUP_LOCAL_ROTATE_KEEP_LAST`

### Email

Local backups may be sent to email manually. Set env vars:
- `EMAIL_HOST`
- `EMAIL_PORT`
- `EMAIL_HOST_USER`
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`

Then run:
```sh
docker compose run --rm -e EMAIL_TARGET=youremail@domain.com backups ./backup-db.sh
```

## B2 cloud storage

> In these examples we assume that backups will be stored inside `folder`. If you want to store backups in the root folder, just use empty string instead of `folder`.

First, create a Backblaze B2 account and a bucket for backups (with [lifecycle rules](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-configure-and-manage-lifecycle-rules)):

```sh
b2 bucket create --lifecycle-rule '{"daysFromHidingToDeleting": 30, "daysFromUploadingToHiding": 30, "fileNamePrefix": "folder/"}' "infinite-hashes-backups" allPrivate
```

> If you want to add backups to already existing bucket, use `b2 bucket update` command and don't forget to list all previous lifecycle rules as well as adding the new one.

Create an application key with restricted access to a single bucket:

```sh
b2 key create --bucket "infinite-hashes-backups" --namePrefix "folder/" "infinite-hashes-backups-key" listBuckets,listFiles,readFiles,writeFiles
```

Fill in `.env` file:
- `BACKUP_B2_BUCKET=infinite-hashes-backups`
- `BACKUP_B2_FOLDER=folder`
- `BACKUP_B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=0012345abcdefgh0000000000`
- `BACKUP_B2_APPLICATION_KEY=A001bcdefgHIJKLMNOPQRSTUxx11x22`

## List all available backups

```sh
docker compose run --rm backups ./list-backups.sh
```

## Restoring system from backup after a catastrophical failure

1. Follow the instructions above to set up a new production environment
2. Restore the database using one of
```sh
docker compose run --rm backups ./restore-db.sh /var/backups/{backup-name}.dump.zstd

docker compose run --rm backups ./restore-db.sh b2://{bucket-name}/{backup-name}.dump.zstd
docker compose run --rm backups ./restore-db.sh b2id://{ID}
```
3. See if everything works
4. Make sure everything is filled up in `.env`, error reporting integration, email accounts etc

## Monitoring

`backups` container runs a simple server which [exposes essential metrics about backups](backups/bin/serve_metrics.py).
