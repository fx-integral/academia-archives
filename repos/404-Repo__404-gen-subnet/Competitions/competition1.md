## Competition 1: "Image to 3D Generation (Mesh)"

### What we provide:
1. A Set of 140k+ 2D Image Prompts for Testing;
2. Our base miner [implementation](https://github.com/404-Repo/404-base-miner-mesh) that is ready for Commercial Use; 
3. Judge Code for Evaluating Mesh Outputs. This can be found in this repository ("judge-service" folder);

### Base miner description:
Our Base Miner Implementation Includes:
1. [Trellis 2 (implementation)](https://github.com/404-Repo/404-base-miner-mesh) (Ready for Commercial Use. Produces Mesh Models Only);
2. Docker File. Location: ["docker"](https://github.com/404-Repo/404-base-miner-mesh/tree/main/docker) folder.

### Base miner: some points for improvement:
1. Current UV-unwrapping can be unreliable and slow;
2. Generated materials for the meshes have artifacts (most likely related to uv unwrapping);
3. Mesh rasterization can be improved or replaced with a better method;

### Requirements for Submitted Solution:
1. **Packages/Libraries/Code**: must be permitted for Commercial Use;
2. **Mesh Generator**: you can use any mesh generator that has a permissive licenses for commercial use. 
Our base miner serves as a guidance or starting point.
2. **Correct Mesh File Format**: Models should be stored in <span style="color:green"> GLB </span> file format with an 
approximate size of no more than <span style="color:green"> 200 mb </span>;
3. **Correct Mesh Orientation**: <span style="color:green"> Y-axis up </span>;
4. **Correct Mesh Size**: mesh model must be scaled to fit within a unit cube. If it will be of wrong size, 
your results might not pass Duels evaluation. 
4. **Asset Quality**: the Solution must significantly visually improve the quality of the generated assets compared 
to the output of our base miner;
5. **Proof of work**: We will require Miner to generate Models for 128 prompts per evaluation.
5. **Generation time**: <span style="color:green"> Trimmed Median: ≤ 90 s. Hard Timeout: 180 s (= Failure). </span>;
6. **The Solution** must be published in a <span style="color:green"> public Git repository </span>;
7. **All External Dependencies** must be pinned to specific versions or commit hashes for reproducibility. This includes:
   - **pip packages**: use exact versions (e.g., `torch==2.1.0`, not `torch>=2.0`)
   - **Huggingface models/repos**: pin to a specific revision hash
   - **Git dependencies**: use commit SHAs, not branch names
   - **Docker base images**: use digest or specific tag (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04`)
   
   ⚠️ Submissions with unpinned or floating dependencies may be disqualified, as non-reproducible builds cannot be fairly evaluated.

### Requirements for Docker File:
1. The Repository must include a <span style="color:green"> "docker/Dockerfile" </span>;
2. The Dockerfile must expose port 10006: <span style="color:green"> EXPOSE 10006 </span>;
3. The  Docker Image must run an HTTP Server listening on <span style="color:green"> 0.0.0.0:10006 </span>;
4. Docker Image Build Time: <span style="color:green"> 2-3 Hours Maximum </span>;
5. Docker Container Startup + Warmup: <span style="color:green"> 30 minutes Max </span>;
6. Should be runnable on NVIDIA cards with compute capabilities: <span style="color:green"> 8.9, 9.0, 10.0 and 12.0 </span>;

### Requirements for API / Endpoints:
You need to implement two endpoints:

<span style="color:green"> POST /generate </span>:

- Inputs: 
  - Image File - multipart/form-data; 
  - Seed - fixed generation seed number (for reproducibility);
- Output: 
  - GLB File Stream - application/octet-stream

```python
# FastAPI example:
@app.post("/generate")
async def generate_model(prompt_image_file: UploadFile = File(...), seed: int = Form()) -> Response:
    # Your generation logic here
    return StreamingResponse(glb_stream, media_type="application/octet-stream")
```
<span style="color:green"> GET /health </span>:

- Health Check Endpoint.

```python
# FastAPI example:
@app.get("/health")
def health_check() -> dict[str, str]:
    """ Return if the server is alive """
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

Your solution:
1. Must handle each request sequentially (one at a time)
2. The Orchestrator will send the next request immediately after receiving response headers
3. The Orchestrator will NOT wait for model download to complete before sending the next request.


### Timing & Request Handling:
Time is measured from Request Sent to Response Headers Received. Body Download Time is NOT counted.
