# Allways

**Universal Transaction Layer**

Trustless native transactions across independent assets — Bittensor Subnet 7 (SN7).

## Overview

Allways creates a verification layer above independent systems. Assets move natively. Miners complete transactions, validators independently verify the results, and a smart contract enforces outcomes through collateral and slashing.

Currently live with BTC ↔ TAO. Designed to scale to any verifiable asset.
## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Bittensor wallet
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

### Running with Docker

**Miner:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.miner.yml up -d
```

**Validator:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.vali.yml up -d
```

Both require a `.env` file with `PORT` and `WALLET_PATH` configured.

### CLI

```bash
uv sync
# activate the uv virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

alw --help
```

## Architecture

- **Miners**: Post exchange rate pairs and collateral, fulfill swap orders
- **Validators**: Monitor swaps, verify on-chain transactions, vote on outcomes
- **Smart Contract**: Manages collateral, swap lifecycle, and validator voting
- **CLI**: User interface for posting pairs, managing collateral, and executing swaps

## Validator Storage Layout

Validator state lives in `~/.allways/validator/state.db` (SQLite, WAL mode).
Tables: `pending_confirms`, `rate_events`, `swap_outcomes`. Collateral /
active / min_collateral state is held in memory and rebuilt from contract
events each startup; only `swap_outcomes` (the all-time credibility ledger)
needs to persist across restarts.

## Miner Environment Variables

- `MINER_TIMEOUT_CUSHION_BLOCKS` — defaults to 5. Miner skips fulfilling a
  swap when fewer than this many blocks remain before its timeout, trading
  a skipped swap for avoided slashes on slow dest-chain inclusion.
- `BTC_MODE`, `BTC_PRIVATE_KEY`, `BTC_RPC_URL`, etc. — see `.env.example`.

## Running a Local Subtensor Lite Node (Validators)

Validators read miner rate commitments every ~3 minutes AND stream contract
events every block via the same connection. Pointing at the public `finney`
entrypoint works but adds latency and RPC pressure — every validator on the
network should run its own lite node for this.

```bash
# Minimal lite-node command (adjust --base-path for storage volume)
subtensor \
  --chain finney \
  --base-path /var/lib/subtensor \
  --rpc-external \
  --ws-external \
  --port 30333 \
  --rpc-port 9933 \
  --ws-port 9944 \
  --pruning 1000
```

Then point the validator at it via `.env`:

```env
SUBTENSOR_NETWORK=ws://127.0.0.1:9944
```

The dev environment in `alw-utils/dev-environment` provisions a local chain
automatically — no manual lite-node step is required there.
