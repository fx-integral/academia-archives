# BitAds | Subnet 16

BitAds is a decentralized, proof of sale marketing network where merchandisers stake or rent ALPHA to own marketing bandwidth,<br> and miners earn on verified sales.

## How It Works
- Campaign owners stake the required marketing bandwidth (SN16 ALPHA tokens) to launch a BitAds campaign.
- Miners promote BitAds campaigns across any platforms they choose, turning their reach and creativity into real sales.
- Validators score the miners and reward them based on their marketing performance.

## For Miners

Miners drive traffic and conversions to BitAds campaigns and are rewarded based on:
- **Verified sales:** Number of successful sales
- **Revenue contributions:** Total revenue generated in USD
- **Low refund ratios**
- **Overall contribution to campaign success**

See [Mining Guide](docs/mining.md) for details.

## For Validators

Validators collect miner performance data, calculate scores, and submit weights to the Bittensor network. The scoring algorithm evaluates miners using:

1. **Refund Rate**: $\text{ref}_i = \min(1, \frac{{\text{refund}\_\text{orders}}_i}{\max(1, \text{sales}_i)})$
2. **Sales Normalization**: Square root normalization against P95 percentile
3. **Revenue Normalization**: Logarithmic normalization against P95 percentile
4. **Base Score**: $15$% sales + $85$% revenue
5. **Final Score**: $\text{score}_i = \text{base}_i \times (1 - \text{ref}_i)$

See [Validating Guide](docs/validating.md) for setup instructions.

## Scoring Algorithm

### BitAds Miner Score

**Purpose**: Compute a bounded score in $[0,1]$ per miner for the last 30 days, combining:
- Sales volume (weight 15%)
- Revenue in USD (weight 85%)
- Refund rate as a multiplicative penalty

This is outlier-resistant, easy to implement, and aligned with merchant value.

### Inputs (per miner i, last 30 days)

- `sales_i` (integer ≥ 0): number of verified orders (post-webhook truth)
- `rev_i` (float ≥ 0): sum of verified revenue in USD
- `refund_orders_i` (integer ≥ 0): number of refunded orders among the verified ones

**Derived**:
- $\text{ref}_i = \frac{{\text{refund}\_\text{orders}}_i}{\max(1, \text{sales}_i)}$ (refund rate in $[0,1]$)

> **Note**: If `sales_i = 0`, the score will be 0 regardless of refunds, which is intended.

### Network Reference Values (for normalization)

Compute across all active miners in the same 30-day window (or campaign-level):
- $P95_{\text{sales}}$ = 95th percentile of $\{\text{sales}_j\}$
- $P95_{\text{rev}}$ = 95th percentile of $\{\text{rev}_j\}$

**Why percentiles?** P95 provides a robust scale that ignores extreme whales (top 5%). It adapts automatically as the network performance changes.

**Indexing**: For $N$ miners sorted ascending, P95 is value at index $\lceil 0.95 \times N \rceil$ (1-indexed).

### Normalization with Diminishing Returns

We compress extremes (many sales or huge revenue) to keep the score fair.

Let $\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$ (to avoid division by zero) and define:

$${\text{sales}\_\text{norm}}_i = \min\left(1, \frac{\sqrt{\text{sales}_i}}{\max(\sqrt{P95_{\text{sales}}}, \varepsilon)}\right)$$

$${\text{rev}\_\text{norm}}_i = \min\left(1, \frac{\ln(1 + \text{rev}_i)}{\max(\ln(1 + P95_{\text{rev}}), \varepsilon)}\right)$$

- $\sqrt{\cdot}$ rewards volume while reducing dominance of very high counts
- $\ln(1+\cdot)$ rewards revenue while compressing very large tickets
- Each normalized component is in $[0,1]$ by construction

### Weights (fixed)

- $w_{\text{sales}} = 0.15$
- $w_{\text{rev}} = 0.85$

Compute the base (pre-refund) score:

$$\text{base}_i = w_{\text{sales}} \times {\text{sales}\_\text{norm}}_i + w_{\text{rev}} \times {\text{rev}\_\text{norm}}_i$$

$\text{base}_i \in [0,1]$

### Refund Penalty (multiplicative)

If we have 10% refunds, multiply score by 0.90.

General rule:

$${\text{refund}\_\text{multiplier}}_i = 1 - \text{ref}_i \quad \text{(in } [0,1] \text{)}$$

**Example**: $\text{ref}_i = 0.25$ → multiplier = $0.75$ ($-25\%$ to score)

### Final Score (bounded)

$$\text{score}_i = \text{base}_i \times {\text{refund}\_\text{multiplier}}_i$$

Result is guaranteed in $[0,1]$.

### Worked Examples

#### Example A (balanced high performer)

- **Network**: $P95_{\text{sales}} = 60$, $P95_{\text{rev}} = 4,000$
- **Miner A** (last 30d):
  - $\text{sales}_i = 48$
  - $\text{rev}_i = 2,300$
  - ${\text{refund}\_\text{orders}}_i = 6$ → $\text{ref}_i = \frac{6}{48} = 0.125$ → mult = $0.875$

**Compute**:
$$\text{sales}\_\text{norm} = \frac{\sqrt{48}}{\sqrt{60}} = \frac{6.928}{7.746} \approx 0.894$$

$$\text{rev}\_\text{norm} = \frac{\ln(2301)}{\ln(4001)} = \frac{7.741}{8.294} \approx 0.933$$

$$\text{base} = 0.15 \times 0.894 + 0.85 \times 0.933 = 0.134 + 0.793 = 0.927$$

$$\text{score} = 0.927 \times 0.875 = 0.811$$

#### Example B (few sales, higher $ per sale)

- **Same network P95s**
- **Miner B**:
  - $\text{sales}_i = 10$
  - $\text{rev}_i = 3,000$
  - ${\text{refund}\_\text{orders}}_i = 1$ → $\text{ref}_i = 0.10$ → mult = $0.90$

$$\text{sales}\_\text{norm} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt{60}} = \frac{3.162}{7.746} \approx 0.408$$

$$\text{rev}\_\text{norm} = \frac{\ln(3001)}{\ln(4001)} = \frac{8.007}{8.294} \approx 0.965$$

$$\text{base} = 0.15 \times 0.408 + 0.85 \times 0.965 = 0.061 + 0.820 = 0.881$$

$$\text{score} = 0.881 \times 0.90 = 0.792$$

A wins on volume and slightly better refund rate; B is very strong on revenue.

#### Example C (no sales)

- **Miner C**: $\text{sales}_i = 0$, $\text{rev}_i = 0$, ${\text{refund}\_\text{orders}}_i = 0$ → $\text{score} = 0$

### Edge Cases & Guardrails

- **Zero P95s** (tiny networks or new epoch): Use $\max(\sqrt{P95_{\text{sales}}}, \varepsilon)$ and $\max(\ln(1+P95_{\text{rev}}), \varepsilon)$; with $\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$ the expression remains safe.

- **Sales < 3 floor (optional)**: To avoid 1-sale flukes, you can soft-cap:
  ```python
  if sales_i < 3:
      score_i *= 0.3  # only 30% credit until 3 sales
  ```
  (Not required by the spec, but commonly used.)

- **Refunds > sales** (data noise): Clamp: $\text{ref}_i = \min(1, \frac{{\text{refund}\_\text{orders}}_i}{\max(1, \text{sales}_i)})$.

- **Campaign vs. global P95**: Preferred: compute per-campaign P95 to keep things fair across low-ticket vs high-ticket campaigns. For a global leaderboard, average per-campaign scores with weights = campaign budget or impressions.

- **Smoothing P95 (optional)**: To avoid jumps between epochs:
  $$P95_{\text{sales},t} = \alpha \times P95_{\text{sales},\text{cur}} + (1-\alpha) \times P95_{\text{sales},\text{prev}}$$
  $$P95_{\text{rev},t} = \alpha \times P95_{\text{rev},\text{cur}} + (1-\alpha) \times P95_{\text{rev},\text{prev}}$$
  with $\alpha \in [0.3, 0.5]$.

- **Data integrity**: Only include webhook-verified sales/revenue and confirmed refunds/chargebacks in the 30-day window.

### Implementation

The scoring algorithm is implemented in the `bitads-v3-core` library:
- Pure, deterministic, and unit-testable
- No external dependencies
- Available on PyPI: [bitads-v3-core](https://pypi.org/project/bitads-v3-core/)

## Burn Mechanism

The burn mechanism automatically adjusts the percentage of emissions that are burned to prevent miners from becoming over-profitable when emissions exceed the value they generate.

### The Problem

When emitted ALPHA surpasses the value of verified sales, miners earn more than they contribute. This excess profit often gets sold into the market, increasing sell pressure and destabilizing ALPHA’s price.

**Example**: Miners generate $10,000 in sales, but emissions are worth $30,000. The excess $20,000 creates over-profitability and sell pressure.

### How It Works

The burn mechanism automatically calculates and applies a burn percentage based on the relationship between sales and emissions:

1. **Get total emissions** for the period (in TAO)
2. **Convert to USD**: Multiply by current TAO/USD price
3. **Get total sales**: Sum of actual sales generated by miners (in USD)
4. **Get target ratio**: Fetch the target sales-to-emission ratio from external API
   - `1.0` = 1:1 ratio (miners earn what they generate)
   - `1.5` = 1.5:1 ratio (miners can earn up to 1.5× their sales)
   - `2.0` = 2:1 ratio (more generous, but more burn needed if sales fall behind)
5. **Calculate burn percentage**:
   - If emissions ≤ sales × ratio: burn = 0%
   - Otherwise: burn = (emissions - sales × ratio) / emissions × 100%

### Formula

$$\text{burn}\_\text{percentage} = \max\left(0, \frac{{\text{emission}\_\text{usd}} - {\text{sales}\_\text{usd}} \times {\text{target}\_\text{ratio}}}{{\text{emission}\_\text{usd}}} \times 100\right)$$

The result is clamped to $[0.0, 100.0]\%$.

### Examples

#### Example 1: No Burn Needed

- **Emissions**: $10,000 USD
- **Sales**: $10,000 USD
- **Target ratio**: 1.0 (1:1)

$$\text{burn} = \frac{10,000 - 10,000 \times 1.0}{10,000} \times 100 = 0\%$$

No burn needed since emissions match sales at the target ratio.

#### Example 2: Burn Required

- **Emissions**: $15,000 USD
- **Sales**: $10,000 USD
- **Target ratio**: 1.0 (1:1)

$$\text{burn} = \frac{15,000 - 10,000 \times 1.0}{15,000} \times 100 \approx 33.3\%$$

Approximately 33% of emissions need to be burned to maintain the 1:1 ratio.

#### Example 3: With 1.5:1 Ratio

- **Emissions**: $20,000 USD
- **Sales**: $10,000 USD
- **Target ratio**: 1.5 (1.5:1)

Expected emissions at 1.5:1 ratio: $10,000 × 1.5 = $15,000

$$\text{burn} = \frac{20,000 - 15,000}{20,000} \times 100 = 25\%$$

25% burn needed since emissions exceed the more generous 1.5:1 ratio.

### Automatic Operation

The burn percentage is calculated automatically by validators:

1. **Periodic calculation**: Validators recalculate the burn percentage every day.
2. **Data fetching**: Validators fetch:
   - Total emissions in TAO (from chain)
   - TAO/USD price (from price oracle)
   - Total sales in USD (from sales API)
   - Target sales-to-emission ratio (from configuration API)
3. **Weight application**: The calculated burn percentage is applied by sending that percentage of weights to the subnet creator's hotkey (UID 0)
4. **Automatic burning**: Emissions sent to the creator hotkey are automatically burned by the chain

No manual configuration or validator updates are required—the system adjusts automatically based on current sales and emissions data.
