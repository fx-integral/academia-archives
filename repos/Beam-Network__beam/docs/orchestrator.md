## Overview

### What is an Orchestrator?

In the BEAM Network, orchestrators are the "miners" on Bittensor. Unlike traditional mining, orchestrators coordinate bandwidth work rather than computing hashes.

### Architecture (BeamCore V2)

This repository speaks to **BeamCore V2** ([`beamcore_v2`](https://github.com/Beam-Network/beamcore_v2)): **core-server** (HTTP API + control plane, port **8000**), **orch-gateway** (orchestrator WebSocket edge, **8002**), and **worker-gateway** (worker WebSocket edge, **8001**). See BeamCore’s `README.md` and `docs/docs/architecture.md` for the canonical diagram.

**Logical paths**

- **Clients / validators** → `core-server` over HTTP.
- **You (orchestrator)** ↔ `orch-gateway` over WebSocket; the gateway relays to core-server’s upstream relay — assignments and control-plane traffic are **push-style over WS**, not periodic HTTP polling for assignments.
- **Workers** ↔ `worker-gateway` over WebSocket for task offers. Beam may host a shared worker-gateway; operators can also run an **orchestrator-owned** worker gateway URL registered with BeamCore.
- **Bytes** move directly between storage connectors; **they do not pass through** core-server.

**Execution pipeline in BeamCore:** `transfers → transfer_assignments → tasks → task_results → proofs_of_bandwidth → payments`. Task states: `pending → offered → in_progress → completed | failed | cancelled`.

**PRISM:** orchestrator routing uses **qualifying** vs **qualified** pools and `prism_final_score`; confidence gates full production routing (BeamCore docs).

**End-to-end flow (simplified)**

1. Client creates a transfer on **core-server** (HTTP).
2. Control plane assigns chunks to orchestrators (PostgreSQL authoritative state; redistribution / guardrail timers in BeamCore).
3. Your node keeps the **orch-gateway** session alive and receives work; you **offer** tasks to workers over **worker-gateway** paths.
4. Workers execute chunk transfers and POST **payment / PoB evidence** to **core-server** HTTP.
5. Validators read metrics / PRISM inputs from BeamCore and set weights on chain; emissions follow Bittensor epochs.

**This orchestrator is responsible for**

1. **orch-gateway connectivity** — reconnect promptly; disconnects risk reassignment.
2. **Worker pool** — route offers, track accept/reject/completion as implemented in this codebase.
3. **Reporting** — payment epochs and orchestrator-facing reports as wired to BeamCore HTTP.
4. **Pool quality** — ultimately reflected in PRISM (throughput, reliability, performance, readiness/confidence, penalties).

> **Note:** Workers use the **worker-gateway** URL (`BUFFER_URL` in worker env), not core-server port 8000, for WebSocket task delivery. That gateway may be Beam-operated or your own; both are valid in BeamCore V2.

### Network Information

| Network | Subnet UID | Subtensor | BeamCore URL                |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| Testnet | 304        | `test`    | https://beamcore-dev.b1m.ai |
| Mainnet | 105        | `finney`  | https://beamcore.b1m.ai     |

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

| Component | Minimum    | Recommended         |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| CPU       | 4 cores    | 8+ cores            |
| RAM       | 8 GB       | 16 GB               |
| Storage   | 100 GB SSD | 250 GB NVMe SSD     |
| Network   | 100 Mbps   | 1 Gbps+             |
| Public IP | Required   | Static IP preferred |

### Why These Requirements?

- **CPU**: Task scheduling, proof verification, and API handling
- **RAM**: Worker state management, proof aggregation, metagraph sync
- **Storage**: Proof storage, logs, database (if local)
- **Network**: Must handle API requests and BeamCore communication
- **Public IP**: BeamCore needs to reach your orchestrator for health checks

- Debian 12
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Bittensor Wallet Setup

You need a Bittensor wallet with:

- A coldkey (keeps your TAO safe)
- A hotkey (used for signing, stays on server)

```bash
# Install bittensor CLI
pip install bittensor

# Create wallet
btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name orchestrator
btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name orchestrator --wallet.hotkey default
```

### 2. Register on Subnet as Miner

Orchestrators register as "miners" on the Bittensor subnet:

**Testnet:**

```bash
btcli subnet register --netuid 304 --subtensor.network test \
    --wallet.name orchestrator --wallet.hotkey default
```

**Mainnet:**

```bash
btcli subnet register --netuid 105 --subtensor.network finney \
    --wallet.name orchestrator --wallet.hotkey default
```

### 3. Verify Registration and Get Your UID

```bash
btcli wallet overview --wallet.name orchestrator --subtensor.network test
```

You should see your UID (2-151 for public orchestrators).

### 4. Prepare Hotkey for Server Use

For automated deployments, use an unencrypted hotkey:

```bash
btcli wallet regen-hotkey \
  --wallet.name orchestrator \
  --wallet.hotkey default \
  --no-use-password \
  --overwrite

# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 ~/.bittensor/wallets/orchestrator/hotkeys/default
```

---

## Installation

### Option A: Direct Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Beam-Network/beam.git
cd beam

# 2. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# 4. Navigate to orchestrator
cd neurons/orchestrator
```

### Option B: systemd Service (Production)

Use a checkout layout with `.venv` at the repository root and `neurons/orchestrator/`. Substitute `/srv/beam` below for your deploy path unless you regenerate paths via templating (`systemd` unit files **do not** expand shell variables literally).

Create `/etc/systemd/system/beam-orchestrator.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=BEAM Orchestrator
After=network.target redis.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=beam
WorkingDirectory=/srv/beam/neurons/orchestrator
Environment="PATH=/srv/beam/.venv/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
EnvironmentFile=/srv/beam/neurons/orchestrator/.env
ExecStart=/srv/beam/.venv/bin/python main.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

# Security
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ReadWritePaths=/srv/beam /var/log/beam /tmp/beam_logs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable beam-orchestrator
sudo systemctl start beam-orchestrator
```

### Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Orchestrator API
sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp

# Redis (if external)
sudo ufw allow 6379/tcp

# Optional: Prometheus metrics
sudo ufw allow 9090/tcp
```

## Running the Orchestrator

### Start the Orchestrator

```bash
cd neurons/orchestrator
source ../.venv/bin/activate

python main.py
```

### Verify It's Running

1. **Health check:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected:

```json
{
	"status": "healthy",
	"uid": 5,
	"hotkey": "5Gk...",
	"workers": 0,
	"active_tasks": 0
}
```

2. **Check state:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/state | jq
```

3. **View logs:**

```bash
tail -f /tmp/beam_logs/orchestrator.log
```

### Expected Startup Sequence

```
INFO | Starting BEAM Orchestrator...
INFO | Wallet: orchestrator/default
INFO | Network: test (netuid: 304)
INFO | Syncing metagraph...
INFO | Metagraph synced: 10 neurons
INFO | Orchestrator UID: 5
INFO | BeamCore connection: https://beamcore-dev.b1m.ai
INFO | Starting API server on 0.0.0.0:8000
INFO | Ready to accept workers
```

## Worker Management

### How Workers Connect

Workers connect to a **worker-gateway** WebSocket (env: worker `BUFFER_URL`). That gateway may be the **shared Beam worker-gateway** or an **orchestrator-owned** gateway URL registered with BeamCore — not the core-server HTTP port (8000).

```
Worker → WebSocket → worker-gateway → (BeamCore internal relay) → task offers
Worker → HTTP → core-server — PoB / payment evidence posted here
```

### Attracting Workers

Workers affiliate with orchestrators based on:

1. **Uptime** - Reliable orchestrators get more tasks assigned
2. **Performance** - BeamCore routes more chunks to orchestrators with higher Prism scores
3. **Geographic Coverage** - Workers in diverse regions improve performance

### Monitoring Workers

```bash
# Worker stats
curl http://localhost:8000/workers/stats | jq

# Full orchestrator state
curl http://localhost:8000/state | jq
```

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Endpoints

| Endpoint             | Description             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `GET /health`        | Basic health status     |
| `GET /state`         | Full orchestrator state |
| `GET /metrics`       | Prometheus metrics      |
| `GET /metrics/json`  | JSON metrics            |
| `GET /workers/stats` | Worker statistics       |

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Worker Count** - Should grow over time
2. **Task Success Rate** - Target 95%+
3. **Payment Success** - All workers should be paid
4. **Wallet Balance** - Keep funded for worker payments

### Log Locations

| Log          | Location                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Orchestrator | `/tmp/beam_logs/orchestrator.log`    |
| systemd      | `journalctl -u beam-orchestrator -f` |

### Wallet Balance Management

Your orchestrator pays workers from its wallet. Keep it funded:

```bash
# Check balance
btcli wallet balance --wallet.name orchestrator

# Transfer TAO to orchestrator hotkey
btcli wallet transfer --dest {orchestrator_hotkey} --amount 10
```

**Payment retry system:**

- Failed payments are queued and retried every 60 seconds
- Up to 5 retry attempts per payment
- After 5 failures, payment is dropped (validator penalty applies)

### Updating the Orchestrator

```bash
cd beam
git pull origin main

# Restart
sudo systemctl restart beam-orchestrator
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Hotkey not registered"

```
ERROR | Hotkey not registered on subnet 304
```

**Solution:** Register as a miner:

```bash
btcli subnet register --netuid 304 --subtensor.network test \
    --wallet.name orchestrator --wallet.hotkey default
```

#### 2. "Enter your password" at startup

The hotkey is encrypted.

**Solution:** Regenerate without encryption:

```bash
btcli wallet regen-hotkey --wallet.name orchestrator \
    --wallet.hotkey default --no-use-password --overwrite
```

#### 3. "BeamCore connection failed"

```
ERROR | Failed to connect to BeamCore
```

**Solutions:**

- Verify `SUBNET_CORE_URL` is correct
- Check network connectivity: `curl https://beamcore-dev.b1m.ai/health`

#### 4. No tasks being assigned

**Solutions:**

- Verify BeamCore connection is working
- Ensure orchestrator is registered on the subnet
- Check logs for **orch-gateway** WebSocket errors, registration, and assignment handling

#### 5. Worker payments failing

```
WARNING | Payment failed: insufficient balance
```

**Solutions:**

- Add TAO to orchestrator wallet
- Check payment retry queue
- Verify wallet hotkey is accessible

### Debug Mode

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python main.py
```

## Economics and Rewards

### How Orchestrators Earn

```
Bittensor Emissions
        │
        ▼
Validator sets weights based on Prism performance score
        │
        ▼
Orchestrator receives emissions
        │
        └─► Workers (paid per completed task)
```

### Performance Scoring (Prism)

BeamCore scores orchestrators using the Prism engine, which computes a routing score from real task outcomes over a 24-hour window:

| Metric               | Description                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Task success rate    | Completed vs total tasks               |
| Bandwidth throughput | Average Mbps across workers            |
| Reassignment rate    | Tasks handed off due to worker failure |
| Timeout rate         | Tasks that exceeded deadline           |
| Payment compliance   | Epoch payments submitted and verified  |

Validators read these scores from BeamCore and set on-chain weights accordingly. Higher scores → more chunk assignments → more emissions.

### Maximizing Rewards

1. **Maintain high uptime** (99%+)
2. **Attract quality workers** with reliable infrastructure
3. **Keep wallet funded** for worker payments
4. **Use reliable infrastructure** (low latency, good bandwidth)
5. **Monitor and fix issues quickly**
