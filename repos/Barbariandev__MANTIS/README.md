## Architecture

Validators sample miner payloads every `SAMPLE_EVERY` blocks, decrypt them after a timelock maturation window, and store (embedding, price) pairs in a SQLite database. Periodically, walk-forward scoring computes per-hotkey salience for each challenge, aggregates across challenges by weight, applies EMA smoothing, and sets on-chain weights.

## Challenges

All challenges are defined in `config.py` under `CHALLENGES`. Each specifies a `ticker`, `dim`, `blocks_ahead` (forward horizon in blocks at 12s/block), `loss_func` (scoring dispatch key), and `weight` (relative importance in final aggregation).

| Challenge | Ticker | dim | Horizon | loss_func | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ETH-1H-BINARY | `ETH` | 2 | 300 (1h) | `binary` | 1.0 | Binary direction prediction |
| CADUSD-1H-BINARY | `CADUSD` | 2 | 300 | `binary` | 1.0 | " |
| NZDUSD-1H-BINARY | `NZDUSD` | 2 | 300 | `binary` | 1.0 | " |
| CHFUSD-1H-BINARY | `CHFUSD` | 2 | 300 | `binary` | 1.0 | " |
| XAGUSD-1H-BINARY | `XAGUSD` | 2 | 300 | `binary` | 1.0 | " |
| ETH-HITFIRST | `ETHHITFIRST` | 3 | 500 | `hitfirst` | 2.5 | Barrier-hit direction |
| ETH-LBFGS | `ETHLBFGS` | 17 | 300 (1h) | `lbfgs` | 3.5 | Volatility regime + quantile paths |
| BTC-LBFGS-6H | `BTCLBFGS` | 17 | 1800 (6h) | `lbfgs` | 2.875 | " |
| MULTI-BREAKOUT | `MULTIBREAKOUT` | 2/asset | event | `range_breakout_multi` | 5.0 | Range breakout continuation/reversal (33 assets) |
| XSEC-RANK | `MULTIXSEC` | 1/asset | 1200 (4h) | `xsec_rank` | 3.0 | Cross-sectional return ranking (33 assets) |
| FUNDING-XSEC | `FUNDINGXSEC` | 1/asset | 2400 (8h) | `funding_xsec` | 4.0 | Cross-sectional funding rate ranking (20 assets) |

## Scoring

### Per-challenge scoring

Each `loss_func` has its own scoring path. All use L2 logistic regression and coefficient-based importance, but the structure differs.

**Binary** (`binary`) — Walk-forward with ElasticNet meta-model. Feature selection: per-miner L2 logistic on first half, AUC on second half, select top-$K$ (default 50). Meta-model: ElasticNet logistic (L1 ratio 0.5) on OOS base-model predictions across walk-forward segments. Importance = $|\beta_j|$. Segments weighted by recency.

**LBFGS** (`lbfgs`) — Two independent scoring paths blended 75/25:
- *Classifier path* (`compute_linear_salience`): per-class L2 logistic regressions on 5-bucket argmax predictions. Importance = $\beta_j^2$ summed across classes. Vectorized balanced accuracy evaluation. Uniqueness penalty suppresses miners with >85% argmax overlap with higher-ranked peers.
- *Q-path* (`compute_q_path_salience`): 12 independent binary L2 logistic models (one per tail-bucket / sigma-threshold combination). Importance = averaged $|\beta_j|$ across sub-models.

Both paths are individually top-$K$ renormalized with exponential rank decay before blending.

**HITFIRST** (`hitfirst`) — Two L2 logistic regressions on logit-transformed miner probabilities: one for up-barrier-hit ($y=1$ if price hits $+\sigma$ first), one for down-barrier-hit. Importance = $|\beta_j^{\text{up}}| + |\beta_j^{\text{down}}|$. No walk-forward — single fit on all valid samples.

**MULTI-BREAKOUT** (`range_breakout_multi`) — Operates on completed breakout events (not time series). Two-stage: (1) Empirical AUC gate — per-miner AUC on $P_{\text{continuation}}$ vs realized label, requiring AUC > 0.5 and ≥ 2 temporal episodes. (2) L2 logistic on z-scored miner predictions with episode-balanced sample weighting (each temporal episode gets equal total weight regardless of event count). Importance = $|\beta_j|$.

**XSEC-RANK** (`xsec_rank`) — Cross-sectional binary reformulation: label = 1 if asset's forward return exceeds the cross-sectional median. All assets pooled ($N_{\text{assets}} \times$ sample multiplier). Walk-forward meta-model: feature selection by per-miner univariate AUC, top-$K$ (default 20) selected, L2 logistic meta-model. Importance per segment:

$$
w_j = |\beta_j| \cdot \max\!\Big(\frac{\text{AUC}_{\text{meta}} - 0.5}{0.5},\; 0\Big)
$$

Segments aggregated with exponential recency weighting.

**FUNDING-XSEC** (`funding_xsec`) — Same structure as XSEC-RANK but on funding rate changes instead of price returns. Embargo = $\max(\text{LAG}, \text{ahead})$ with explicit `train_cutoff = val_start - ahead` to prevent label leakage from forward-looking labels. Stale miners (temporal std < $10^{-4}$ per asset column) zeroed before pooling.

### Sybil resistance

L2 regularization splits coefficient mass among correlated miners. If $n$ clones submit identical predictions, each receives $\approx w/n$ weight. L1 (in binary challenges) or the uniqueness penalty (in LBFGS) drives zero-information or duplicate miners to zero.

### Weight aggregation

Per-challenge salience vectors are normalized to sum to 1, multiplied by challenge weight, and averaged:

$$
s_j = \frac{1}{\sum_c w_c} \sum_c w_c \cdot \hat{s}_{j,c}
$$

EMA smoothing ($\alpha = 0.15$) is applied across weight-setting intervals to reduce block-to-block variance. Degenerate distributions (near-uniform or zero-sum) are rejected.

## Encryption

Dual-path encryption ensures no party can observe predictions before maturation:

1. **Owner path** — X25519 ECDH + ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD. The owner can decrypt immediately for trading.
2. **Timelock path** — Drand IBE (BLS12-381). After the specified Drand round, validators decrypt via the published beacon signature.

A SHA-256 binding hash over (hotkey, round, owner_pk, ephemeral_pk) is used as AAD, preventing replay, relay, and substitution attacks.

## Storage

SQLite with WAL mode. Tables:

- **`challenge_meta`** — `(ticker)` → `dim`, `blocks_ahead`
- **`block_index`** — Sequential index → block number mapping
- **`raw_payloads`** — Encrypted ciphertexts held until maturation
- **`drand_cache`** — Cached beacon signatures
- **`breakout_state`** — Serialized range tracker state

Training data is streamed via generator iteration, not loaded into memory.

## Model Iteration Tool

The [MANTIS Model Iteration Tool](https://github.com/BarbarianDev/mantis_model_iteration_tool) is a standalone framework for developing, backtesting, and iterating on MANTIS mining strategies. It provides autonomous agent-driven research, walk-forward evaluation with causal data access, and a web dashboard for tracking iterations across all challenge types. See the [repository](https://github.com/BarbarianDev/mantis_model_iteration_tool) for setup and SDK documentation.
