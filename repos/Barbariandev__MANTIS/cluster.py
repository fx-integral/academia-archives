Deterministic sybil-cluster detection and salience collapse.

Motivation
----------
On each weight-calculation cycle, every challenge's scorer fits an L2 (or
ElasticNet) logistic regression over miner embeddings.  When a cluster of
N near-identical clones submits the same predictions, the loss surface is
*flat* in the cluster's coefficient subspace: many splits of the cluster's
total weight across its members yield nearly identical loss.

The exact convergence point of L-BFGS in that flat subspace is sensitive
to ULP-level numerical noise, which differs between validators because
runtime CPU dispatch in BLAS picks different SIMD micro-kernels on
different hardware.  Two validators with byte-identical input data can
therefore end up assigning the cluster's weight to *different* clones
(say, clone17 on validator A vs clone23 on validator B).  The within-
cluster total agrees, but the per-key allocation flickers — and that
flicker dominates Vtrust loss in competitive challenges.

This module provides the fix:

  1. ``find_clusters`` discovers tight clusters of clones from raw
     embedding histories using a *conservative* pairwise criterion.
  2. ``select_representatives`` picks the lex-min hotkey of each cluster
     as the canonical representative (purely deterministic, independent
     of UID re-registration, metagraph sync timing, or data noise).
  3. ``collapse_salience`` re-attributes every cluster member's salience
     to the cluster's representative, summing the masses.

Conservatism
------------
The pairwise match criterion is intentionally strict:

  - Two miners are linked iff their per-timestep embeddings agree to
    within ``MATCH_EPS`` on at least ``MIN_MATCH_FRACTION`` of joint-active
    timesteps (default 1e-3 / 99 %).
  - Both miners must have at least ``MIN_SUBMISSIONS`` non-zero rows and
    they must share at least ``MIN_JOINT`` joint-active timesteps.
  - Linkage is single-linkage (transitive closure over pairwise matches).

Two miners running materially different strategies will not survive the
99 % match-fraction at ε ≈ one float16 ULP.  False-negatives (missing a
true clone pair) are far cheaper than false-positives (merging non-clones)
for the Vtrust use case, so the defaults err on the strict side.

Determinism notes
-----------------
Drand decryption misses on validator X drop entire timesteps for *all*
miners simultaneously, so the joint-active mask between any two miners
differs by at most a few percent across validators (and the drop is the
same whole rows for both miners in the pair).  Decryption itself is
byte-deterministic, so embedding values on jointly-decrypted timesteps
are bit-identical between validators.  Therefore the pairwise
match-fraction and the resulting union-find structure are stable across
validators with high probability.  The lex-min representative pick is
purely deterministic given the cluster set.
