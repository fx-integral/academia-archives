## Design overview

Refer to the [Bitsec docs](https://docs.bitsec.ai) for the latest documentation.

run Run the agent execution and evaluation locally via Docker (recommended).  
run-no-docker Run the agent execution and evaluation locally as a script
execute-agent Run the miner agent script locally on a single project.

```bash
./bitsec.py miner execute-agent
```

Agent file is in miner/agent.py

project source files are fetched and stored in projects/

```bash
projects/
```

change project id in miner/agent.py to the project you want to run

```
report = agent_main('projects/code4rena_secondswap_2025_02', inference_api=inference_api)
```

Platform API (Central Hub): A FastAPI server acting as the "subnet platform."

- Endpoint: /upload/agent (POST) – Accepts a single agent.py file upload. Validate it's Python, uses only stdlib (simple regex check). Store in local folder with metadata (e.g., miner_id as filename).
- Endpoint: /tasks (GET) – Returns a list of simple coding tasks (hardcoded: e.g., "Implement a function reverse_string(s: str) -> str").

Miner Script: A simple Python script or CLI.

- Takes a task prompt.
- Optionally uses LLM to generate code (e.g., prompt: "Write Python code for [task] as a function in agent.py").
- Uploads generated agent.py to the API.

Validator Script: The core evaluator (run manually or via cron-like loop).

- Pulls all submitted agents from local storage.
- For each agent and task:Spin up a Docker container.
- Copy agent.py into it, run python agent.py --task [prompt] (assume agents have a main function).
- Capture output, run basic tests (e.g., assert reverse_string("hello") == "olleh").

- Score: 0-100 based on tests passed (e.g., 100 if all pass).
- Output rankings to console/JSON (simulate "emissions/rewards").

Sandbox Execution: Use Docker SDK to:

- Create container: docker run -v [host_dir]:/app python:3.11-slim python /app/agent.py
- Limit resources (CPU/time) to prevent hangs.
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., timeout after 10s).

Demo workflow:

1. Miner: Generate/submit 2-3 sample agents (one good, one bad).
2. Validator: Run eval, show scores like "Agent1: 100 (reward: 50 'TAO')".

Validator: Run eval, show scores like "Agent1: 100 (reward: 50 'TAO')".

## In order to simplify the building of subnets, this template abstracts away the complexity of the underlying blockchain and other boilerplate code. While the default behavior of the template is sufficient for a simple subnet, you should customize the template in order to meet your specific requirements.

```python
python -m venv env; source env/bin/activate;
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
