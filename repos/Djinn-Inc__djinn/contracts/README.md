## Protocol Overview

Djinn unbundles **information from execution** in sports betting. Analysts ("Geniuses") sell encrypted predictions. Buyers ("Idiots") purchase access to those predictions and execute bets independently at their own sportsbooks. Signals stay encrypted forever; the real prediction is hidden among 10 decoy lines in an AES-256-GCM encrypted blob. Track records are finalized on-chain via validator consensus (OutcomeVoting) — anyone can read a Genius's settlement history directly from the `Audit` contract.

The protocol is deployed on Base chain and settled in USDC (6 decimals). All financial math operates in USDC's 6-decimal precision.

**Core lifecycle:**

1. A Genius commits an encrypted signal with parameters (sport, price, SLA commitment, notional bounds, expiry).
2. One or more Idiots purchase the signal, paying a fee and specifying their own notional and odds. V6 adds `purchaseV2` which additionally commits per-purchase BPA/WPA Merkle roots on-chain for settlement-time challenge-and-respond, and `depositWithPermit` which collapses the first-time-buyer approve + deposit into a single signed transaction (where the underlying USDC supports EIP-2612).
3. Bittensor validators (off-chain) observe game outcomes via MPC without revealing which line was the real pick.
4. Settlement runs per genius-idiot pair on a rolling batch basis: once ≥10 of the pair's purchases have resolved, validators vote the aggregate (`quality_score`, `wins`, `losses`, `voids`, `n`) via `OutcomeVoting`, and on 2/3+ consensus `Audit` finalizes the batch, releases collateral, and distributes damages. Either party may trigger `earlyExit` to settle whatever has resolved so far.

---

## Architecture

All core contracts use the **UUPS proxy pattern** (OpenZeppelin v5) with a **TimelockController** as the owner. This means:

- Every upgradeable contract is deployed behind an `ERC1967Proxy`.
- The `_authorizeUpgrade` function requires `onlyOwner` on all contracts. Contracts holding USDC (Escrow, Collateral, Audit) additionally require `whenPaused`.
- Base Sepolia uses a **72-second** delay (reduced from the original 72h on 2026-04-14 via the timelock itself, for fast-iterate testnet upgrades). Base mainnet deploys will use a separate TimelockController with the conservative 72-hour delay (`259200` seconds). The deployer is the sole proposer; anyone can execute after the delay expires. There is no admin role (self-governing).
- Ownership of all upgradeable contracts is transferred to the TimelockController at deployment time.
- Upgrades follow the **additive-only rule**: each new implementation must add new functions/events/storage slots and leave existing bytecode untouched. Feature discovery happens at runtime via `supportsFeature(bytes32 featureId)` so web clients can degrade gracefully against pre-V6 deployments.

**Exception:** `KeyRecovery` is deployed as a plain (non-upgradeable, non-proxy) contract. It holds no funds and has no admin functions.

Cross-contract authorization uses per-contract `authorizedCallers` mappings. Only the owner (TimelockController) can add or remove authorized callers.

## Contract Descriptions

### SignalCommitment.sol

**Purpose:** Stores encrypted signal commitments on-chain.

A Genius commits a signal by calling `commit()` with:
- A client-generated `signalId` (uint256, UUID v4 mapped to uint256 for privacy; sequential IDs would leak activity patterns).
- An AES-256-GCM `encryptedBlob` (max 64 KB) containing the real prediction.
- A `commitHash` (bytes32) for future verification.
- 10 `decoyLines` (9 decoys + 1 real), which obscure the actual pick.
- Signal parameters: `sport`, `maxPriceBps` (fee rate, 1-5000 bps), `slaMultiplierBps` (100%-1000%), `maxNotional`, `minNotional`, `expiresAt`.
- A list of `availableSportsbooks` (max 50).

**Signal lifecycle (state machine):**
```
Active --> Cancelled  (by genius via cancelSignal, or by authorized contract)
Active --> Settled    (by authorized contract after audit)
Cancelled --> Settled (existing purchases still settle normally)
Settled               (terminal, no transitions)
```

**Key validations:**
- `slaMultiplierBps` must be between 10,000 (100%) and 100,000 (1000%).
- `maxPriceBps` must be between 1 and 5,000 (0.01% to 50%).
- `expiresAt` must be in the future.
- Exactly 10 decoy lines are required.
- Each decoy line is capped at 1 KB; sport and sportsbook names at 256 bytes each.

### Escrow.sol

**Purpose:** Holds Idiot USDC deposits and processes signal purchases.

**Deposit/Withdraw:** Idiots deposit USDC into their escrow balance before purchasing signals. Withdrawals return unused balance.

**Purchase flow (`purchase()`):**
1. Validates signal is active, not expired, and the buyer is not the genius.
2. Enforces one purchase per Idiot per signal (`hasPurchased` mapping).
3. Validates notional is within signal's min/max bounds and global bounds (1 USDC to 1M USDC).
4. Validates odds are within range (1.01x to 1000x, in 6-decimal precision).
5. Computes fee: `notional * maxPriceBps / 10_000`.
6. Splits fee between credits (burned first) and USDC (deducted from escrow balance).
7. Records the purchase with an auto-incrementing `purchaseId`.
8. Tracks cumulative `signalNotionalFilled` against the signal's `maxNotional`.
9. Accumulates USDC fees in a per-genius-idiot-cycle `feePool`.
10. Locks genius collateral: `notional * slaMultiplierBps / 10_000 + notional * 50 / 10_000` (SLA lock + 0.5% protocol fee lock).
11. Records the purchase in the Account contract.

**Fee claims:** After a cycle is settled, the Genius can claim accumulated USDC fees via `claimFees()` or `claimFeesBatch()`. A 96-hour monitoring delay (`FEE_CLAIM_DELAY`) applies after settlement before fees become claimable, giving the protocol team time to detect and respond to incorrect settlements.

**Outcome recording:** Authorized callers (oracle adapters, validator bridges) can set purchase outcomes via `setOutcome()`. This syncs outcomes to both Escrow and Account.

**Key design decision:** Odds are buyer-chosen, not genius-specified. The buyer executes at their own sportsbook where available odds may differ. The Quality Score formula is intentionally asymmetric: favorable outcomes credit the actual value delivered, while unfavorable outcomes apply a fixed SLA penalty independent of odds.

### Collateral.sol

**Purpose:** Holds Genius USDC collateral to cover worst-case damages on active signals.

**Deposit/Withdraw:** Geniuses deposit USDC collateral. Withdrawals are limited to free (unlocked) collateral: `available = deposits - locked`.

**Lock/Release:** At purchase time, Escrow locks collateral equal to the SLA obligation plus protocol fee. At settlement, Audit releases these locks before distributing damages. Locks are tracked both per-genius (aggregate) and per-genius-per-signal (granular).

**Slash:** The Audit contract can slash genius collateral to pay damages (Tranche A) or protocol fees. `slash()` returns the actual amount slashed, which may be less than requested if deposits are insufficient. Signal locks must be released before slashing to maintain accounting invariants.

**Withdrawal freeze:** During settlement, the Audit contract freezes genius withdrawals to prevent front-running collateral extraction. Withdrawals are unfrozen after settlement completes.

### Account.sol

**Purpose:** Tracks the relationship state between each Genius-Idiot pair across audit cycles.

The primary key is `(genius, idiot)`, hashed via `keccak256(abi.encode(genius, idiot))`.

**Cycle mechanics:**
- Each pair progresses through independent audit cycles.
- Each cycle holds up to `SIGNALS_PER_CYCLE` (10) purchases.
- When the 10th purchase is recorded, the pair becomes "audit-ready."
- After settlement, `settleAudit()` resets the cycle: increments `currentCycle`, zeroes `signalCount` and `outcomeBalance`, clears purchase records and outcomes.

**State tracked per pair:**
- `currentCycle`: Current audit cycle number (starts at 0).
- `signalCount`: Number of purchases recorded in the current cycle.
- `outcomeBalance`: Running tally of outcomes (+1 favorable, -1 unfavorable, 0 void).
- `purchaseIds`: Array of purchase IDs in the current cycle.
- `settled`: Whether the current cycle has been settled.

**Active pair tracking:** `activePairCount` tracks how many pairs have at least one purchase in their current cycle. Incremented on first purchase, decremented on settlement.

### Audit.sol

**Purpose:** Settlement engine. Computes Quality Scores, distributes damages, and manages cycle transitions.

**Quality Score computation (`computeScore()`):**

For each purchase in the cycle:
- **Favorable:** `+notional * (odds - 1e6) / 1e6`
- **Unfavorable:** `-notional * slaMultiplierBps / 10_000`
- **Void/Pending:** Skip (no effect)

The score is bounded by `MAX_QUALITY_SCORE` (1 billion USDC) to prevent overflow.

**Settlement paths:**

1. **Standard settlement (`settle()` / `trigger()`):** Permissionless. Any address can call once the pair is audit-ready (10 signals) and all outcomes are finalized. Computes on-chain Quality Score from recorded outcomes.

2. **Voted settlement (`settleByVote()`):** Called by OutcomeVoting when 2/3+ validators agree on an aggregate quality score. The score is computed off-chain via MPC. Individual purchase outcomes are never written on-chain (privacy preservation).

3. **Early exit (`earlyExit()`):** Either party can trigger before 10 signals. All damages are paid as Credits only (no USDC movement), since the sample size is insufficient for USDC settlement. The 0.5% protocol fee is still charged to prevent fee dodging.

4. **Voted early exit (`earlyExitByVote()`):** Same as voted settlement but for early exits.

5. **Force settlement (`forceSettle()`):** Owner-only (TimelockController) emergency settlement for stuck or orphaned cycles.

**Damage distribution (negative Quality Score):**

- **Tranche A (USDC):** Genius collateral is slashed and sent directly to the Idiot. Capped at the total USDC fees the Idiot paid in this cycle. Per the whitepaper: "You can never extract more USDC than you put in."
- **Tranche B (Credits):** Excess damages beyond the Tranche A cap are minted as non-transferable Djinn Credits to the Idiot. If a collateral slash returns less than intended, the shortfall moves from Tranche A to Tranche B.
- **Protocol Fee:** 0.5% of total notional, slashed from genius collateral to the protocol treasury.

**Settlement sequence:**
1. Freeze genius withdrawals.
2. Compute protocol fee (0.5% of total non-void notional).
3. Release all signal collateral locks for purchases in the cycle.
4. If score < 0: distribute damages (Tranche A USDC + Tranche B Credits).
5. Slash protocol fee from collateral to treasury.
6. Store `AuditResult` (qualityScore, trancheA, trancheB, protocolFee, timestamp).
7. Unfreeze genius withdrawals.
8. Advance the Account to the next cycle.

### OutcomeVoting.sol

**Purpose:** On-chain aggregate voting for signal outcomes via validator consensus.

Validators independently compute quality scores off-chain using MPC (multi-party computation), then vote on the aggregate result on-chain. Individual purchase outcomes never go on-chain, preventing retroactive identification of real picks from on-chain data.

**Voting mechanics:**
- Each validator submits a vote via `submitVote(genius, idiot, qualityScore)`.
- Votes are tracked per `(genius, idiot, cycle)` tuple.
- Each validator can vote once per cycle.
- When 2/3+ validators agree on the same quality score, settlement is triggered automatically by calling `Audit.settleByVote()` or `Audit.earlyExitByVote()`.

**Validator management:**
- Owner (TimelockController) can add/remove validators for bootstrap and emergencies.
- Validators can propose a full set replacement via `proposeSync()`. When 2/3+ of current validators propose the same sorted set at the same nonce, the set is atomically replaced.
- Minimum 3 validators required at all times.
- The `syncNonce` increments on every validator set change to prevent stale proposals.

**Anti-manipulation:**
- `cycleValidatorSnapshot`: Snapshots the validator count when the first vote is cast for a cycle, preventing quorum manipulation by adding/removing validators mid-vote.
- `cycleSyncNonce`: If the validator set changes after the first vote, the cycle resets for re-voting.

**Early exit requests:**
- Either party (Genius or Idiot) can call `requestEarlyExit()` to flag a cycle for early exit.
- Validators then vote on the quality score. If quorum is reached and the cycle has fewer than 10 signals, settlement uses the early exit path (Credits only).

### CreditLedger.sol

**Purpose:** Non-transferable, non-cashable protocol credits used as fee discounts.

Credits are minted as Tranche B during negative audit settlements and burned by Escrow when an Idiot uses them to offset a purchase fee. This is intentionally NOT an ERC20. Credits cannot be transferred, approved, or redeemed for cash. They exist solely to give Idiots partial compensation for poor genius performance, applied as discounts on future signal purchases.

**Functions:**
- `mint(to, amount)`: Called by Audit during settlement.
- `burn(from, amount)`: Called by Escrow during purchase.
- `balanceOf(account)`: Returns credit balance.

### KeyRecovery.sol

**Purpose:** Stores encrypted wallet recovery blobs for users.

Users encrypt their signal decryption keys to their wallet public key and store the blob on-chain (max 4 KB). This enables key recovery from any device: the user logs in with their wallet, retrieves the blob, and decrypts locally. The blob is encrypted, so reading it reveals nothing without the wallet's private key.

This is a plain (non-upgradeable) contract with no admin functions. Only `msg.sender` can store their own blob. Anyone can read any blob.

### Key Fund Flow Properties

- Idiot USDC enters through `Escrow.deposit()` and exits through `Escrow.withdraw()` (unused balance) or `Collateral.slash()` to the Idiot (Tranche A damages).
- Genius USDC enters through `Collateral.deposit()` and exits through `Collateral.withdraw()` (free collateral), `Collateral.slash()` to the Idiot (damages), `Collateral.slash()` to treasury (protocol fee), or `Escrow.claimFees()` (earned fees from the Escrow fee pool).
- Tranche A damages go directly from Collateral to the Idiot's wallet (not back through Escrow).
- Credits are purely virtual (minted/burned in CreditLedger, never backed by USDC).

---

## Access Control

### Owner: TimelockController

All upgradeable contracts are owned by a single `TimelockController` with:
- **Delay:** 72 hours (259,200 seconds).
- **Proposer:** Multisig address (single proposer configured at deployment).
- **Executor:** `address(0)`, meaning anyone can execute a queued proposal after the delay.
- **Admin:** None (`address(0)`). The TimelockController is self-governing.

Owner-restricted operations include: upgrading contracts, setting contract addresses, managing authorized callers, adding/removing validators, setting the protocol treasury, unpausing, and `forceSettle()`.

### Pauser

Each pausable contract has a dedicated `pauser` address that can call `pause()`. Both the pauser and the owner can pause. Only the owner can unpause. The pauser address is set by the owner via `setPauser()`. Setting the pauser to `address(0)` disables the dedicated pauser role (owner can still pause).

### Authorized Callers (Cross-Contract)

Contracts authorize each other for specific cross-contract calls:

| Caller | Authorized On | Can Call |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Escrow | Collateral | `lock()` |
| Escrow | CreditLedger | `burn()` |
| Escrow | Account | `recordPurchase()` |
| Escrow | SignalCommitment | `updateStatus()` |
| Audit | Collateral | `lock()`, `release()`, `slash()`, `freezeWithdrawals()`, `unfreezeWithdrawals()` |
| Audit | CreditLedger | `mint()` |
| Audit | Account | `recordOutcome()`, `settleAudit()`, `setSettled()`, `startNewCycle()` |
| OutcomeVoting | Audit | `settleByVote()`, `earlyExitByVote()` (via dedicated `outcomeVoting` address check) |

### Permissionless Functions

- `Audit.settle()` / `Audit.trigger()`: Anyone can trigger settlement once a pair is audit-ready and all outcomes are finalized.
- `Escrow.purchase()`: Any address (except the genius) can purchase a signal.
- `SignalCommitment.commit()`: Any address can commit a signal.
- `KeyRecovery.storeRecoveryBlob()`: Any address can store their own recovery blob.

---

## Upgrade Model

All upgradeable contracts use the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern from OpenZeppelin v5.

**`_authorizeUpgrade` requirements per contract:**

| Contract | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| SignalCommitment | `onlyOwner` |
| Escrow | `onlyOwner` + `whenPaused` |
| Collateral | `onlyOwner` + `whenPaused` |
| Audit | `onlyOwner` + `whenPaused` |
| Account | `onlyOwner` + `whenPaused` |
| CreditLedger | `onlyOwner` + `whenPaused` |
| OutcomeVoting | `onlyOwner` + `whenPaused` |
Contracts that hold USDC (Escrow, Collateral) or orchestrate USDC movement (Audit) require the contract to be paused before an upgrade can be authorized. This prevents upgrades while funds are in active transit.

**Storage gaps:** Every upgradeable contract reserves a `__gap` array for future storage variables. Gap sizes vary by contract (33 to 48 slots) to bring total storage slots to a consistent ceiling.

**Upgrade scripts:** `script/Upgrade.s.sol` and `script/ExecuteUpgrade.s.sol` handle proposal-based upgrades through the TimelockController. Contract-specific redeploy scripts (`RedeployAccount.s.sol`, `RedeployEscrow.s.sol`) are also provided.

## Security Properties

### Reentrancy Protection

- Escrow, Collateral, Audit, and OutcomeVoting use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuardTransient` (EIP-1153 transient storage). Base supports transient storage post-Dencun, so the reentrancy guard uses `tstore`/`tload` with no persistent storage slot. This avoids proxy storage layout concerns entirely.
- All external functions that transfer USDC or modify critical state are protected with `nonReentrant`.
- Escrow follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern: state changes are finalized before external calls.

### Pause Mechanism

- All contracts with financial operations implement `PausableUpgradeable`.
- Both the dedicated `pauser` and the `owner` (TimelockController) can pause.
- Only the owner can unpause (prevents a compromised pauser from toggling).
- Pause blocks: deposits, withdrawals, purchases, signal commitments, settlements, and voting.

### Front-Running Mitigations

- **Signal IDs:** Client-generated random 256-bit IDs prevent front-running with predictable sequential IDs.
- **Track record proofs:** Commit-reveal pattern with block-based timing prevents proof front-running.
- **Collateral withdrawals:** Frozen during settlement to prevent extraction before slashing.

### Self-Purchase Policy

- Self-purchases (`sig.genius == msg.sender`) are **allowed**. A Genius that
  wants to inflate their track record via a sock-puppet Idiot wallet can
  already do so trivially with a second address, so blocking the literal
  same-address case adds no security and only confuses legitimate users.
  Sybil-style track-record inflation is addressed via economic friction
  (collateral, fees, per-pair purchase limits) rather than an on-chain
  same-address check. See DEVIATIONS.md for the history.

### One-Purchase-Per-Signal-Per-Idiot

- `Escrow.hasPurchased[signalId][msg.sender]` prevents duplicate purchases.

### Upgrade Safety

- Contracts holding USDC require `whenPaused` for upgrade authorization.
- TimelockController enforces a delay on all owner operations (72h on
  mainnet, 72s on Base Sepolia for fast iteration), providing time to
  detect and respond to malicious upgrade proposals.
- Every upgrade must be **additive-only** per the Djinn upgrade rule: new
  functions, events, and storage slots only. Existing bytecode stays
  untouched. Feature discovery via `supportsFeature(bytes32)` lets clients
  degrade gracefully against older deployments.

## Deployment

### Initial Deployment

The `Deploy.s.sol` script handles the complete deployment:

1. Deploys USDC (MockUSDC on testnet, uses real USDC on mainnet at `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`).
2. Deploys all implementation contracts and wraps them in `ERC1967Proxy` instances.
3. Wires cross-contract references (Audit to Escrow, Escrow to Collateral, etc.).
4. Sets up authorized callers for cross-contract calls.
5. Configures the pauser address on all pausable contracts.
6. Deploys a `TimelockController` (72h delay, multisig as proposer, anyone as executor).
7. Transfers ownership of all contracts to the TimelockController.
8. Runs a comprehensive verification pass to confirm all wiring, authorization, pauser, and ownership settings.

```shell
# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with DEPLOYER_KEY, PROTOCOL_TREASURY, MULTISIG_ADDRESS, PAUSER_ADDRESS

# Deploy to Base Sepolia
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $BASESCAN_API_KEY
```

### Post-Deployment Upgrades

Upgrades go through the TimelockController:

1. Deploy the new implementation contract.
2. Propose the `upgradeToAndCall()` transaction via the TimelockController (72h delay).
3. After the delay, anyone can execute the queued upgrade.

See `script/Upgrade.s.sol` and `script/ExecuteUpgrade.s.sol` for the upgrade workflow.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DEPLOYER_KEY` | Private key of the deployer account |
| `PROTOCOL_TREASURY` | Address that receives the 0.5% protocol fee (defaults to deployer) |
| `MULTISIG_ADDRESS` | Proposer for the TimelockController (defaults to deployer) |
| `PAUSER_ADDRESS` | Emergency pauser address (defaults to deployer) |
| `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` | RPC endpoint for Base Sepolia |
| `BASESCAN_API_KEY` | API key for contract verification on BaseScan |
