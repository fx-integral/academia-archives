# Djinn Validator

Bittensor Subnet 103 validator for the Djinn Protocol. Validators challenge miners to verify sports betting line availability, dispatch TLSNotary attestation tasks, manage peer notary assignment, and set on-chain weights based on miner performance.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set required environment variables (see below)
export BT_NETWORK=finney
export BT_WALLET_NAME=default
export BT_WALLET_HOTKEY=default
export BASE_VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Run the validator
uv run python -m djinn_validator
```

The validator starts a FastAPI server on port 8421 (configurable via `API_PORT`) and enters the epoch loop concurrently.

## Epoch Loop

Every ~12 seconds the validator runs one epoch iteration:

1. **Metagraph sync** (30s timeout). Discovers registered miners and prunes deregistered UIDs from the scorer.
2. **Health checks**. Pings every miner's `/health` endpoint (5s timeout). Parses capability data (memory, CPU, TLSNotary session headroom) from JSON responses. Miners that don't respond are marked as down.
3. **Sports challenge** (every 50 epochs, ~10 minutes). Picks a live sport from ESPN, constructs a mix of real and synthetic betting lines, sends the same challenge to all miners concurrently, computes cross-miner consensus, and requests TLSNotary proofs from outliers.
4. **Attestation challenge** (every 100 epochs, ~20 minutes). Probes all miners for `/v1/attest` capability, discovers peer notaries, then dispatches full TLSNotary attestation tasks to capable miners with assigned peer notaries.
5. **Outcome resolution**. Resolves pending signal outcomes using public ESPN game data.
6. **MPC audit settlement**. When a pair's queue has ≥10 resolved-but-unaudited purchases (v2) or its legacy 10-signal cycle is full and all resolved (v1), runs batch MPC to compute aggregate quality scores and submits on-chain votes.
7. **Weight setting** (every 100 blocks). Computes blended scores, applies burn fraction, and sets weights on the Bittensor chain.

After weights are set, per-epoch metrics reset while preserving consecutive participation history.

## Miner Scoring

Final weights are a blend of sports and attestation scores:

```
final_score = 0.70 * sports_score + 0.30 * attestation_score
```

### Sports Score (70% of final)

| Component   | Weight | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Accuracy    | 35%    | Fraction of queries matching cross-miner consensus and TLSNotary ground truth |
| Speed       | 25%    | Response latency, normalized across all miners |
| Coverage    | 15%    | Fraction of proof requests where a valid TLSNotary proof was submitted |
| Uptime      | 15%    | Fraction of health checks responded to (with notary bonus, see below) |
| Capability  | 10%    | System resource score from health check capabilities |

### Attestation Score (30% of final)

| Component       | Weight | Description |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| Proof Validity  | 60%    | TLSNotary proof verifies correctly |
| Speed           | 40%    | Attestation latency, normalized independently |

### Notary Freerider Penalty

Miners not running a notary sidecar receive a **50% reduction** on their attestation score. This incentivizes every operator to contribute notary capacity proportional to their miner count.

### Notary Bonus

Miners that reliably serve as peer notaries for other miners receive up to a **10% boost** on their uptime component within the sports score. This rewards network service without changing the weight structure.

### Capability Scoring

The 10% capability component is computed from miner-reported system resources:

- **Memory tier** (0-0.4): 8GB = 0.1, 16GB = 0.2, 32GB = 0.3, 64GB+ = 0.4
- **CPU tier** (0-0.2): 4 cores = 0.05, 8 = 0.1, 16 = 0.15, 32+ = 0.2
- **Memory availability** (0-0.2): ratio of available to total memory
- **Session headroom** (0-0.2): ratio of free to max TLSNotary concurrent sessions

Miners that do not report capabilities receive a neutral score of 0.3 (not penalized, not rewarded).

### Empty Epoch Weights

When no miners have been challenged (no active signals):

- Without attestation data: Uptime 50%, History 50% (consecutive participation, log-scaled)
- With attestation data: Uptime 35%, History 30%, Attestation 35%

## Capability-Aware Scheduling

Validators parse miner capabilities from health check responses and use them for:

- **Scoring**: 10% of sports weight goes to the capability component.
- **Attestation dispatch**: miners with available TLSNotary capacity are preferred for challenge selection.
- **Notary ranking**: fully loaded notaries receive up to 30% score penalty in `rank_notary_candidates`, which combines notary duty reliability (50%), attestation validity (35%), and uptime (15%) with a capacity factor.
- **Smart routing**: the concurrency semaphore (4 simultaneous attestation challenges) and per-notary assignment caps prevent overwhelming any single miner.

## Attestation Dispatch

Attestation challenges select miners in two phases:

### Phase 1: Discovery (~5 seconds)

Runs in parallel:
- **Capability probe**: POST empty body to all miners' `/v1/attest`. Miners that return 422 (validation error) have the endpoint; 404 or timeout means they don't.
- **Notary discovery**: GET `/v1/notary/info` from all miners, then WebSocket handshake probe on `/v1/notary/ws` to verify the sidecar actually accepts connections.

### Phase 2: Full Challenge (~210 seconds)

All capable miners receive a real attestation task. Each miner is assigned a peer notary for the TLSNotary MPC session:

- **Peer notary assignment**: weighted-random selection from `rank_notary_candidates` output. Same-IP exclusion prevents collusion between miners on the same machine. Each notary is capped at `max_per_notary` assignments per round (minimum 4, scales with pool size).
- **Proof verification**: the validator verifies TLSNotary proofs against the expected server name and the assigned notary's public key.
- **Notary duty tracking**: when a proof verifies, the notary miner gets credit toward its notary reliability score.

## MPC Audit Flow

Validators compute quality scores for genius-idiot pairs through multi-party computation without revealing which betting line is the real one:

1. **Share collection**. Each signal's secret index (which of the 10 lines is real) is Shamir-secret-shared across validators at purchase time.
2. **Outcome resolution**. ESPN game results determine each line's outcome (FAVORABLE, UNFAVORABLE, or VOID) using public data. No MPC is needed at this stage.
3. **Batch MPC settlement**. Settlement runs queue-based per genius-idiot pair (see DEV-039): as soon as at least `MIN_BATCH_SIZE` (default 10) of the pair's purchases have resolved outcomes and haven't been audited yet, `batch_settle_audit_set` reconstructs the secret index via polynomial interpolation over Shamir shares to select the real outcome for each signal. No individual signal outcome is ever revealed to any single validator. Cycle-based settlement (v1) is legacy; the store's `contract_version` selects which path to use and auto-migrates existing sets when it flips.
4. **Quality score computation**. Matches the on-chain `Audit.sol computeScore()` formula:
   - FAVORABLE: `+notional * (odds - 1e6) / 1e6`
   - UNFAVORABLE: `-notional * sla_bps / 10_000`
   - VOID: `0`
5. **On-chain vote**. The aggregate quality score, total notional, wins, losses, voids and sample count are submitted to the `OutcomeVoting` contract. Only the aggregate is published; individual signal results remain private. `Audit.sol` finalizes the batch once 2/3+ of staked validators agree.

In prototype/dev mode, index reconstruction happens locally. In production with distributed MPC, each validator holds one Shamir share and polynomial evaluation prevents any single validator from learning any index. A distributed HTTP-driven MPC batch settlement runtime (DEV-044) is flag-gated behind `DJINN_FF_BATCH_SETTLEMENT_HTTP` for staged rollout.

### Observability

- `GET /v1/audit/summary` returns bucket counts (`waiting_for_outcomes`, `ready_for_settlement`, `permanently_abstained`, `settled`) across all tracked sets for a given validator. Use this to detect settlement stalls at a glance. `permanently_abstained` is a subset of `ready_for_settlement` evicted by the v1716 abstain counter — settle-eligible = `ready_for_settlement - permanently_abstained`.
- `GET /v1/audit/{genius}/{idiot}/status?cycle=N` returns per-pair detail.
- `GET /v1/metrics/attestations?limit=N` returns recent attestation outcomes (used by the `/attest` UI on djinn.gg).
- `GET /v1/report-error/stats` returns feedback-queue health: total reports stored, pending count awaiting GitHub forward, and whether `GITHUB_ERROR_TOKEN` is configured (boolean, no token leaked). Use this to detect a silently-broken feedback pipeline; if `pending` is climbing and `github_token_configured=false`, the operator hasn't provisioned the GitHub PAT and reports are queued locally. Forwarding outcomes are also tracked in the Prometheus counter `djinn_validator_error_report_forward_total{outcome="ok|no_token|http_4xx|http_5xx|network|exhausted"}`.

### Canonical odds + consensus circuit breaker

- `/v1/odds/canonical` (POST) lets validators fan out odds requests to miners in a schema-normalized form (DEV-043). Miner-chosen source with median consensus reducer reduces single-provider dependency.
- CUSUM-based consensus circuit breaker (`/v1/cb/*` endpoints) detects sustained miner divergence and flags TLSNotary appeals when outliers persist.

### Settlement Registration

On-chain settlement requires each validator's signer EOA to be registered on `OutcomeVoting.addValidator(address)` by the contract owner (TimelockController). The flow is opt-in and side-channel-free:

1. Operator sets `BASE_VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` and restarts the validator.
2. `GET /health` now returns `{"validator_signer": "0x...", "settlement_registered": <bool>}`. The address is only published after the operator opts in.
3. The subnet owner / governance script collects signer EOAs from each validator's `/health` (see `scripts/collect-validator-signers.sh`), batches `addValidator` calls via `ScheduleRegisterValidators.s.sol`, and executes after the 72s timelock delay.
4. Once `settlement_registered=true`, the validator's `submitVote` calls will succeed instead of reverting with `NotValidator`.

The set of currently-registered signers is visible on-chain via `OutcomeVoting.validatorCount()` and `isValidator(address)`.
