"""Miner challenge system — cross-miner consensus scoring.

Each epoch, the validator:
1. Picks an active sport and fetches live games from ESPN (free, no API key)
2. Constructs a challenge from real games + synthetic lines
3. Sends the SAME challenge to ALL miners concurrently (Phase 1: Query)
4. Computes per-line consensus from all responses (Phase 2: Consensus)
5. Scores each miner against consensus + synthetic ground truth (Phase 3: Score)
6. Requests TLSNotary proofs from outliers + random sample (Phase 4: Proof)

Miners ARE the oracle — the validator has no ground truth for real lines.
Cross-miner consensus determines correctness; synthetic lines (fake event
IDs) provide absolute ground truth. TLSNotary proofs target outliers.
