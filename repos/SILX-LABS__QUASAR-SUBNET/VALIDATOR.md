# Quasar Validator Spec

Validators run the Quasar evaluation loop for SN24. They watch on-chain model commitments, pre-check submitted Hugging Face repos, run GPU evaluation, compute composite scores, and set weights to the current king.

## Hardware

### Recommended Production GPU
- 1x H100 80GB or better

### Practical Current Minimum
- 1x 48GB NVIDIA GPU, or equivalent setup with enough VRAM for the current evaluator
- 2x RTX 6000 Ada 48GB has been tested successfully

### Not Recommended for Production
- 24GB cards as the main validator GPU
- They may work for local testing or reduced settings, but should not be treated as the production validator target

### Host
- 16+ CPU cores
- 128GB+ RAM
- 500GB+ NVMe SSD
- Stable 1Gbps network
- Linux server, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 preferred

---

## Software

- Python 3.10 or 3.11
- CUDA 12.x
- Recent NVIDIA driver
- Git
- Bittensor wallet registered as a validator on subnet 24
- Hugging Face token recommended
- Quasar attention dependency:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-validator.txt
```

## Validator Runtime

### Default Network Settings

```env
QUASAR_NETWORK=finney
QUASAR_NETUID=24
QUASAR_VALIDATOR_TEMPO=600
SINGLE_EVAL_MODE=1
```

### Wallet Settings

```env
QUASAR_WALLET_NAME=validator
QUASAR_HOTKEY_NAME=validator
QUASAR_WALLET_PATH=/path/to/wallets
QUASAR_STATE_DIR=/path/to/state
```

### Remote GPU (Optional)

```env
QUASAR_EVAL_BACKEND=lium
LIUM_API_KEY=...
QUASAR_LIUM_POD_NAME=quasar-eval
```

---

## Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SILX-LABS/QUASAR-SUBNET.git
cd QUASAR-SUBNET
python -m pip install -r requirements-validator.txt
bash scripts/run_validator.sh
```

### Recommended Process Manager

```bash
pm2 start scripts/run_validator.sh --name quasar-validator
pm2 save
```

---

## Operational Rules

- Run one validator process per hotkey.
- Keep validator state persistent.
- Do not delete `state/` unless intentionally resetting.
- Keep wallet keys on the validator host.
- Do not put wallet keys on rented GPU machines.
- Monitor logs for eval failures, stale state, and weight-setting errors.
- Keep enough GPU headroom; future teacher upgrades may require larger GPUs.
