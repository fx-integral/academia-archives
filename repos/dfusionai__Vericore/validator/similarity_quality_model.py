		Using sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or all-mpnet-base-v2), this model generates sentence embeddings to measure similarity.

		sentence-transformers provides different pretrained models optimized for speed vs accuracy:

		Model	                               Size	    Speed	     Accuracy
		all-MiniLM-L6-v2	                   Small	 ⚡ Fast	   ✅ Good
		paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2	             Small	 ⚡ Fast	   ✅ Good
		all-mpnet-base-v2                  	Medium	 🐢 Slower	 🔥 High Accuracy
		paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2	          Medium	 🐢 Slower	 🔥 High Accuracy
		Converts both the snippet text and extracted webpage content into vector representations.
		Computes cosine similarity between embeddings to determine their semantic closeness.
		A similarity score (ranging from 0 to 1) is compared against a predefined threshold (e.g., >0.85).
		A high score indicates a strong semantic match, confirming that the webpage text conveys the same meaning as the snippet.
