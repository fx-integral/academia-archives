"""Reset `best_kl == 3.0` penalty entries in model_score_history for specific
UIDs/models. Companion to `clear_activation_dqs_below_new_threshold.py`.

Why this exists:
  Clearing an activation-copy DQ removes the entry from disqualified.json but
  leaves the 3.0 penalty already recorded in model_score_history.json. That
  makes select_challengers silently prune the UID via the
  `best_ever > king_kl*2` rule, so the model never gets re-evaluated — the
  threshold bump has no practical effect for already-DQ'd miners.

  This script removes those penalty entries so the cleared UIDs land in
  P1_new ("never evaluated") next round.

Usage:
  python reset_penalty_history_for_cleared_uids.py [--dry-run] UID [UID ...]
  python reset_penalty_history_for_cleared_uids.py [--dry-run] --models A/B C/D ...

Examples:
  # Pass UIDs; models are resolved from the validator log (last 24h)
  python reset_penalty_history_for_cleared_uids.py 191 193 176

  # Pass HF repo names directly
  python reset_penalty_history_for_cleared_uids.py --models best26/sn97-best50874-1000

Idempotent; safe to run twice. Writes a .bak file before mutating.
