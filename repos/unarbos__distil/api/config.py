# Distil - Subnet {NETUID} API

Public API for [Distil]({DASHBOARD_URL}), a Bittensor subnet where miners compete to produce the best knowledge-distilled small language models.

## How It Works

Miners submit distilled models and a validator scores each commitment on a **multi-axis composite** (`scripts/validator/composite.py`) anchored on **11 procedurally-generated v31 axes**:

- **Math**: `v31_math_gsm_symbolic` (0.06), `v31_math_competition` (0.05), `v31_math_robustness` (0.03 — GSM-NoOp distractor injection)
- **Code**: `v31_code_humaneval_plus` (0.08 — sandbox-graded, EvalPlus-augmented test cases), `v31_ifeval_verifiable` (0.04 — constraint-driven IFEval)
- **Reasoning**: `v31_reasoning_logic_grid` (0.05 — zebra-puzzle constraint-sat), `v31_reasoning_dyval_arith` (0.04 — arithmetic on dynamic DAGs), `v31_long_context_ruler` (0.05 — NIAH at variable context)
- **Knowledge**: `v31_knowledge_multi_hop_kg` (0.04 — procedural 2–3 hop KG)
- **Honesty**: `v31_truthfulness_calibration` (0.03 — Brier-scored calibration), `v31_consistency_paraphrase` (0.03 — IPT name-rotation consistency)
- **Distillation**: `on_policy_rkl` (0.30), `top_k_overlap` (0.18), `kl` (0.05), `capability` (0.05), `length` (0.05), `degeneracy` (0.05)
- **Quality**: `judge_probe` (0.20), `long_form_judge` (0.20), `long_gen_coherence` (0.25), `chat_turns_probe` (0.10)
- **Discipline**: `reasoning_density` (0.05), `calibration_bench` (0.05)
- **Telemetry tier (composite weight 0)**: legacy `*_bench` and `*_skill_group` axes still RUN every round but no longer touch ranking — they exist for dashboard visibility and `axis_correlation.json`.

**Ranking key** (v31.2): `composite.final = 0.85 × worst_5_mean + 0.15 × weighted` where:
- `worst_5_mean` = equal-weighted mean of the 5 lowest non-broken axes (the API field is named `worst_3_mean` for back-compat but the math is K=5 since the v31.1 variance-reduction sweep on 2026-05-10)
- `weighted` = standard weighted convex combination of all active axes

The king is whoever has the highest `composite.final`. A challenger dethrones only when its final beats the incumbent's by `SINGLE_EVAL_DETHRONE_MARGIN` (default 5% since 2026-05-10, was 3%). The legacy `composite.worst` (single-axis min) is retained as telemetry but is no longer the dethrone gate.
