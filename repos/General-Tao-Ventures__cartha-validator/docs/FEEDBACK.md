- Describe what seems incorrect
- Compare with expected behavior

### RPC/Replay Issues

If you encounter RPC or replay problems:

- Include chain ID and RPC endpoint (redact sensitive parts)
- Share error messages
- Include relevant log snippets
- Note if using `--use-verified-amounts` or full replay

### Performance Feedback

For performance-related feedback:

- Include timing information from logs (replay timing, RPC lag, etc.)
- Note the number of miners being processed
- Share system resources (CPU, memory)
- Compare with previous performance if applicable
- Include weekly epoch information and daily expiry check timing
- Note Bittensor epoch length (tempo) and publishing frequency

## Feedback Best Practices

### Be Specific

- Provide concrete examples
- Include relevant code snippets or logs
- Describe the exact steps you took
- Include command-line arguments used

### Be Constructive

- Focus on the issue, not the person
- Suggest solutions when possible
- Explain the impact of the issue
- Consider security implications

### Be Patient

- Give maintainers time to respond
- Follow up if needed, but be respectful
- Understand that fixes take time
- Remember this is open-source software

## Response Times

We aim to respond to:

- **Critical bugs** (validator crashes, security issues): Within 24 hours
- **General issues**: Within 3-5 business days
- **Feature requests**: Within 1-2 weeks
- **Pull requests**: Within 1 week

## Getting Help

If you need help:

1. Check the [README](../README.md) and [TESTNET_SETUP.md](./TESTNET_SETUP.md)
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for implementation details
3. Search existing issues
4. Ask in discussions
5. Open an issue with your question

## Security Issues

For security-related issues, please:

- **Do NOT** open a public issue
- Email security concerns directly to maintainers
- Include detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow time for a fix before disclosure
