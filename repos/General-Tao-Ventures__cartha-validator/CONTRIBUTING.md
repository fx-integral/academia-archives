# Contributing to Cartha Subnet Validator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Cartha Subnet Validator! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Git
- Basic understanding of Bittensor and EVM blockchains

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cartha-subnet-validator.git
   cd cartha-subnet-validator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   make test
   # or
   uv run pytest
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Find Something to Work On

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/your-org/cartha-subnet-validator/issues)
- Look for `good first issue` labels
- Discuss major changes before starting (open an issue first)

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Run Tests and Linters

```bash
# Run all checks
make test

# Run specific checks
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy cartha_validator
uv run pytest
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve RPC connection timeout issue

- Add retry logic for RPC calls
- Increase default timeout to 30s
- Fixes #123"
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Code Style

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Run `ruff` for linting
- Run `mypy` for type checking

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Add docstrings for public functions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use fixtures for common test data
